<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>This is the online home of <u>Version Control with Subversion</u>,
   a <a href="http://svnbook.red-bean.com/svnbook/ape.html">free</a>
   book about <a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/">Subversion</a>, a
   new version control system designed to supplant CVS.  As you may
   have guessed from the layout of this page, this book is published by
   <a href="http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/0596004486/">O'Reilly Media</a>.</p>

<p>This is a place to
   read HTML and PDF versions of the book (although you can certainly
   <a href="/buy/">buy</a> a copy if you'd like to).  We'll do our best
   to keep the site up-to-date.  As Subversion development continues, the
   product will continue to grow new features, and we plan to continue
   documenting those changes.</p>

<h2>Online Versions of the Book</h2>

<p>There are two online versions of the book, depending on the version
   of Subversion you're using.</p>

<h2>Contributing</h2>

<p>While Subversion book itself is being developed in the Subversion
   open-source community, this site (dedicated to information about
   the book and its published translations) is not managed by the
   community.  Please send any questions, comments, patches, gifts,
   praise, or errors to the appropriate place:</p>

<ul>
<li>For feedback on the book itself, contact
    <tt>&#x64;&#x65;&#118;&#x40;&#x73;&#x75;&#x62;&#x76;&#101;&#x72;&#115;&#105;&#x6f;&#110;&#x2e;&#x74;&#x69;&#103;&#114;&#x69;&#x73;&#x2e;&#x6f;&#114;&#x67;</tt>.
    Be sure to include the word <tt>[BOOK]</tt> in the subject line,
    and <tt>[BOOK PATCH]</tt> if submitting a patch.  Please make your
    patches against the XML sources.</li>
<li>For feedback on this website, contact 
    <tt>&#x77;&#x65;&#x62;&#x6d;&#97;&#x73;&#x74;&#x65;&#x72;&#64;&#115;&#118;&#x6e;&#98;&#111;&#x6f;&#x6b;&#46;&#x6f;&#114;&#103;</tt>.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Translations</h2>

<p>This book has been (or is being) translated to other languages.
   Use the navigation menu at the bottom of the page to select a
   different language.  From each translated page you can obtain the
   book (or a work-in-progress snapshot if it is not finished yet).
   Note that the English version is the master from which all
   translations derive, and if you have any comments about a
   translation you should contact that translation's authors.</p>

<p>Because the book is being developed in the open-source community,
   the primary book authors encourage translators to do their work in
   that community as well, alongside other translators.  Contact the
   Subversion development list to join the efforts.  If you are
   translating the book and would like to publish snapshots of your
   translations here, contact the site webmaster (see above for both
   addresses).</p>

<h2>Are Those Turtles?</h2>

<p>Why, yes, they are, indeed, turtles.  That's the animal chosen by
   the publisher for our book cover.  And before you ask us, "Why?"
   &mdash; we don't really know.  It's cool, and our wives are pleased
   that at least something "icky" wasn't chosen to represent
   Subversion.</p>
