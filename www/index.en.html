<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>This is the online home of <u>Version Control with Subversion</u>,
   a <a href="http://svnbook.red-bean.com/en/1.1/ape.html">free</a>
   book about <a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/">Subversion</a>, a
   new version control system designed to supplant CVS.  As you may
   have guessed from the layout of this page, this book is published by
   <a href="http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/0596004486/">O'Reilly Media</a>.</p>

<p>This is a place to
   read HTML and PDF versions of the book (although you can certainly
   <a href="/buy/">buy</a> a copy if you'd like to).  We'll do our best
   to keep the site up-to-date.  As Subversion development continues, the
   product will continue to grow new features, and we plan to continue
   documenting those changes.</p>

<h2>Online Versions of the Book</h2>

<p>There are two online versions of the book, depending on the version
   of Subversion you're using.</p>

   If you have spotted errors in the book (O'Reilly's hardcopy or
   otherwise), please do the following things:</p>

<ol>
<li>Check the XML sources to see if the problem still exists.  If so,
    report the problem to the mailing list above.  If you have a
    suggested fix for the problem, that's even better &mdash; just
    include a patch against the XML sources in your mail (and include
    the word <tt>[PATCH]</tt> in the subject line).</li>
<li>If the problem is in the published book, check O'Reilly's <a
    href="http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/0596004486/errata/">errata
    page</a> for the book, and report the error there if it hasn't
    already been reported.</li>
</ol>

<p>Remember, the Quality queue is assisted by you.  (Get it &mdash; "queue",
   "you"?  Sheesh&hellip;.)</p>

<h2>Translations</h2>

<p>This book has been (or is being) translated to other languages.
   Use the navigation menu at the bottom of the page to select a
   different language.  From each translated page you can get
   instructions on obtaining the translated book (or a
   work-in-progress snapshot if it is not finished yet).  Note that
   the English version is the master from which all translations
   derive, and if you have any comments about a translation you should
   contact that translation's authors.</p>

<h2>Are Those Turtles?</h2>

<p>Why, yes, they are, indeed, turtles.  That's the animal chosen by
   the publisher for our book cover.  And before you ask us, "Why?"
   &mdash; we don't really know.  It's cool, and our wives are pleased
   that at least something "icky" wasn't chosen to represent
   Subversion.</p>
