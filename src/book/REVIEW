Review and comments on the Subversion book listed by chapter.

Overall Book Comments

            It may be a good idea where possible to set up a little
            example repository for the book.  It could live as

            http://www.svnbook.org/examples/

            All the diff output needs to be updated.  Here's the top
            of the old format:

                $ svn diff
                Index: ./bar.c
                ============================================================
                --- ./bar.c
                +++ ./bar.c     Mon Jul 15 17:58:18 2002

            And here's the top of the new.  I'm using the new internal
            diff engine here.

                $ svn diff
                Index: c
                ============================================================
                --- c   (revision 10)
                +++ c   (working copy)

Chapter 3

        #1) ghudson (also affects ch 9 a little bit)

            The new date parser requires a change to the doc formats.
            A minimal patch can be found in issue #408.

            The new date parser accepts three varieties kinds of
	    formats.  The first is very nicely documented by the W3C
	    in <http://www.w3.org/TR/NOTE-datetime>; we allow the time
	    zone designator to be missing, in which case we use system
	    local time.  The second variety is just like the first
	    variety, except the punctuation characters '-' and ':' are
	    omitted.  The third variety is what we use in the output
	    of "svn log", and can look like:

              YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm[:ss[.uuuuuu]][ +hh[:mm]]

            There can be fewer than six digits in the microseconds
	    designation, and of course the time zone designation may
	    be "-hh[:mm]" instead of "+hh[:mm]".

Chapter 5

    Section svn-ch-5-sect-3.4

	    The section on repository recovery could use some text on
	    permission problems.  It's a common problem as admitted in
	    svn-ch-6-sect-5 ("The most common problem").

    Section svn-ch-5-sect-6

        #1) Blair

            I don't know if the "Adding Projects" sections works best
            here.  It follows pretty specific information on setting
            up a repository, debugging, recovering, which are highly
            specific and not generally used.  This section could be
            missed.  This information is also used by people who
            aren't Subversion "administrator's".  For example, at my
            work, there are people creating new projects pretty
            consistently and we have 61 projects.  While I'm the
            administrator, the users and programmers also need to know
            project layout information.

            There's a repository layout section in chapter 4 that this
            could well be merged into.  If that doesn't work, I would
            consider moving it up to the front of this chapter.

Chapter 6

    Section svn-ch-6-sect-5

	#1) bliss

	    The paragraph that begins with "The most common
	    problem..." says that you may need to put all users in a
	    common group and make sure that the repository is wholly
	    owned by that group and that the umask must be correct. It
	    fails to explain that you most likely need to set the
	    group set-ID bit on the directories for this to work.

        #2) bliss

            The name of the section is Using Multiple Servers, but the
            issues discussed are important even if you don't have a
            server at all (i.e. file://) or if you use tunnel mode.
            Some of it is important only when you don't have a server.
            Not terribly important, but the name could be better.
