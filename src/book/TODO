This is a -*- text -*- file.

Here is a list of all the things that the Subversion Book DOESN'T yet cover.

--------------------------------------------------------------

Stuff that needs more discussion:

  - 'svn diff/merge --ignore-ancestry'.  Demonstrate how this switch
    can be used as an alternate strategy for vendor branching (instead
    of using svn_load_dirs.pl): just import each new vendor release
    unrelatedly, and apply the diffs to your vendor-branch working
    copy.  (note: I at least briefly mention --ignore-ancestry and
    --notice-ancestry in ch09 -Fitz)

  - (perhaps) suggest the use of environment variables to represent
    long repository URLs.  useful for lots of branching/tagging commands.

--------------------------------------------------------------
To be fixed by someone:

  - svnadmin docs sorely need to be updated.  See Ch05 and Ch09.

  - explain that while 'svn import' creates intermediate directories
    for you, 'svn mkdir', 'svn move', and 'svn copy' will not.

--------------------------------------------------------------

To be fixed by cmpilato:

  - ch07: maybe an explanation for the person writing a new main()
    application... what are all those callbacks in the ctx_t used for?
    people have asked this in irc.  what sort of things does an
    application *have* to set up in the cxt_t in order to call an
    svn_client_foo() function?

  - ch07: clarify that svn:externals can only point to directories,
    and that URLs are absolute (so they don't move as part of copies
    or moves, or 'svn switch --relocate').

  - ch07:  'global-ignores' affects 'svn import', but book only
    mentions the effect on 'status' and 'add'

  - appendix A:  explain that we don't support $Log$, and why.

--------------------------------------------------------------

To be fixed by fitz:
  - Check svnadmin and svnlook commands for flags in ch09
    [[ In progress ]]

  - new 'svn diff' UI (when it's done) -- affects ch03, ch09, and
    maybe other chapters.

  - some folks want a glossary.  that's good, since we have a
    glossary.xml anyway.  :-)  probably something we do at the last minute.

To be fixed by sussman:

--------------------------------------------------------------

To be fixed by kfogel:

  - cvs2svn.py is a lot more complex now, with many more switches,
    especially since it now converts branches and tags.  Need to
    expand our coverage of this in Appendix B.
