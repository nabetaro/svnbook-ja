This is a -*- text -*- file.

Here is a list of all the things that the Subversion Book DOESN'T yet cover.

--------------------------------------------------------------

Stuff that needs more discussion:

  - 'svn diff/merge --ignore-ancestry'.  Demonstrate how this switch
    can be used as an alternate strategy for vendor branching (instead
    of using svn_load_dirs.pl): just import each new vendor release
    unrelatedly, and apply the diffs to your vendor-branch working
    copy.  (note: I at least briefly mention --ignore-ancestry and
    --notice-ancestry in ch09 -Fitz)

  - (perhaps) suggest the use of environment variables to represent
    long repository URLs.  useful for lots of branching/tagging commands.

  - some folks want a glossary.  that's good, since we have a
    glossary.xml anyway.  :-)  probably something we do at the last minute.
    (I think O'Reilly does this)

--------------------------------------------------------------
To be fixed by someone:

  - explain that while 'svn import' creates intermediate directories
    for you, 'svn mkdir', 'svn move', and 'svn copy' will not.

To be fixed by fitz:

  - Be clear that PREV, BASE, and COMMITTED only refer to local paths,
    not to URLs.

--------------------------------------------------------------

To be fixed by sussman:

* document 'svn log -v --stop-on-copy branchURL' as the easiest way to
  discover when a branch was created.  This is a major FAQ.
