This is a -*- text -*- file.

Here is a list of all the things that the Subversion Book DOESN'T yet cover.

--------------------------------------------------------------

Stuff that needs more discussion:

  - 'svn diff/merge --ignore-ancestry'.  Demonstrate how this switch
    can be used as an alternate strategy for vendor branching (instead
    of using svn_load_dirs.pl): just import each new vendor release
    unrelatedly, and apply the diffs to your vendor-branch working copy.

  - (perhaps) suggest the use of environment variables to represent
    long repository URLs.  useful for lots of branching/tagging commands.

--------------------------------------------------------------
To be fixed by someone:

  - svnadmin docs sorely need to be updated.  See Ch05 and Ch08.

--------------------------------------------------------------

To be fixed by cmpilato:

  - ch07: maybe an explanation for the person writing a new main()
    application... what are all those callbacks in the ctx_t used for?
    people have asked this in irc.  what sort of things does an
    application *have* to set up in the cxt_t in order to call an
    svn_client_foo() function?

--------------------------------------------------------------

To be fixed by fitz:

  - appendix A: how authentication differs from CVS.  Explain that the
    server challenges, rather than the client explicitly "logging in".

    Also, in 'branches are dirs' section, stress that users would NOT
    want to ever checkout the root of an svn repository.... it would
    be humongous.  Some CVS users have been confused by this.

  - some folks want a glossary.  that's good, since we have a
    glossary.xml anyway.  :-)  probably something we do at the last minute.

  - Check all commands for flags in ch09

  - document the 'autoprops' feature in ~/.subversion/servers

  - new 'svn diff' UI (when it's done) -- affects ch03, ch09, and
    maybe other chapters.

  - document formats accepted by the new dateparser.


--------------------------------------------------------------

To be fixed by sussman:

  - svn merge --dry-run   (different than 'svn diff')

  - ch06: document the log-encoding and use-commit-times variables in
    the [miscellany] section

  - appA should mention no $Log$ keyword.  Or maybe it should mention
    what keywords *do* exist as well.

  - in httpd.conf setup, remind people not to put the svn <Location>
    within an existing DocumentRoot, else the 301 error.

  - rewrite whole chapter 4 example to use project-root layout???

--------------------------------------------------------------

To be fixed by kfogel:

  - cvs2svn.py is a lot more complex now, with many more switches,
    especially since it now converts branches and tags.  Need to
    expand our coverage of this in Appendix B.
