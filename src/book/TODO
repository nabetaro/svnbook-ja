This is a -*- text -*- file.

Here is a list of all the things that the Subversion Book DOESN'T yet cover.

--------------------------------------------------------------

Stuff that needs more discussion:

  - 'svn diff/merge --ignore-ancestry'.  Demonstrate how this switch
    can be used as an alternate strategy for vendor branching (instead
    of using svn_load_dirs.pl): just import each new vendor release
    unrelatedly, and apply the diffs to your vendor-branch working
    copy.  (note: I at least briefly mention --ignore-ancestry and
    --notice-ancestry in ch09 -Fitz)

  - (perhaps) suggest the use of environment variables to represent
    long repository URLs.  useful for lots of branching/tagging commands.

--------------------------------------------------------------
To be fixed by someone:

  - svnadmin docs sorely need to be updated.  See Ch05 and Ch09.

--------------------------------------------------------------

To be fixed by cmpilato:

  - ch07: maybe an explanation for the person writing a new main()
    application... what are all those callbacks in the ctx_t used for?
    people have asked this in irc.  what sort of things does an
    application *have* to set up in the cxt_t in order to call an
    svn_client_foo() function?

--------------------------------------------------------------

To be fixed by fitz:
  - Check svnadmin and svnlook commands for flags in ch09

  - document formats accepted by the new dateparser.

  - new 'svn diff' UI (when it's done) -- affects ch03, ch09, and
    maybe other chapters.

  - some folks want a glossary.  that's good, since we have a
    glossary.xml anyway.  :-)  probably something we do at the last minute.
--------------------------------------------------------------

To be fixed by sussman:


  - appA should mention no $Log$ keyword.  Or maybe it should mention
    what keywords *do* exist as well.

  - in httpd.conf setup, remind people not to put the svn <Location>
    within an existing DocumentRoot, else the 301 error.

  - rewrite whole chapter 4 example to use project-root layout???


--------------------------------------------------------------

To be fixed by kfogel:

  - cvs2svn.py is a lot more complex now, with many more switches,
    especially since it now converts branches and tags.  Need to
    expand our coverage of this in Appendix B.
