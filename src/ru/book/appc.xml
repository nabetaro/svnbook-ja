  <title>Third Party Tools</title>

  <simplesect>

    <para>Subversion's modular design (covered in <xref
      linkend="svn.developer.layerlib"/>) and the availability of
      language bindings (as described in <xref
      linkend="svn.developer.usingapi.otherlangs"/>) make it a likely
      candidate for use as an extension or backend to other pieces of
      software.  In this appendix, we'll briefly introduce you to some
      of the many third-party tools that are using Subversion
      functionality under-the-hood.</para>
