"Developers can employ various work methodologies to keep these logical "

"Subversion 1.5 brings a new <firstterm>changelists</firstterm> feature that "
"adds yet another method to the mix.  Changelists are basically arbitrary "
"labels (currently at most one per file) applied to working copy files for the "
"express purpose of associating multiple files together.  Users of many of "
"Google's software offerings are familiar with this concept already.  For "
"example, <ulink url=\"http://mail.google.com/\">Gmail</ulink> doesn't provide "
"the traditional folders-based email organization mechanism.  In Gmail, you "
"apply arbitrary labels to emails, and multiple emails can be said to be part "
"of the same group if they happen to share a particular label.  Viewing only a "
"group of similarly labeled emails then becomes a simple user interface "
"trick.  Many other Web 2.0 sites have similar mechanisms&mdash;consider the "
"<quote>tags</quote> used by sites such as <ulink url=\"http://www.youtube.com/"
"\">YouTube</ulink> and <ulink url=\"http://www.flickr.com/\">Flickr</ulink>, "
"<quote>categories</quote> applied to blog posts, and so on.  Folks understand "
"today that organization of data is critical, but that how that data is "
"organized needs to be a flexible concept.  The old files-and-folders paradigm "
"is too rigid for some applications."
