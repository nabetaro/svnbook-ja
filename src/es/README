This directory contains the translation of the English book to
Spanish. The project doesn't have a coordinator, but you can seek advice
on the translators mailing list. The address of the mailing list is
l10n-es@subversion.tigris.org.

If you want to change the contents of some file of the translation
project but you are not a translator, please send your proposed
modification to the translation mailing list so it can be verified
and approved by one of the translators. Any made contribution
implies you have read and completely understood the file LEAME.

The build instructions and everything else are in Spanish. TODO
lists pending tasks to be done by the project administrator. TRABAJO
lists the files which are being worked on and the status of the
translation.  glosario_traduccion contains a rough glossary of
translated terms the project has standarised on. publicacion_oficial
contains contact information with Spanish editors. LEAME is the
main file with information about the build, translation rules,
information about the project, etc.
