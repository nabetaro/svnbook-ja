<appendix id="svn.3rdparty">
  <title>Third Party Tools</title>

  <para>Subversion's modular design (covered in <xref
    linkend="svn.developer.layerlib"/>) and the availability of
    language bindings (as described in <xref
    linkend="svn.developer.usingapi.otherlangs"/>) make it a likely
    candidate for use as an extension or backend to other pieces of
    software.  For a listing of many third-party tools that are using
    Subversion functionality under-the-hood, check out the Links page on the
    Subversion website (<ulink
      url="http://subversion.tigris.org/project_links.html"/>).</para>
