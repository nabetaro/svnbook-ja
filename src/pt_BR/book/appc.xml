  <title>Third Party Tools</title>

    <para>Subversion's modular design (covered in <xref
      linkend="svn.developer.layerlib"/>) and the availability of
      language bindings (as described in <xref
      linkend="svn.developer.usingapi.otherlangs"/>) make it a likely
      candidate for use as an extension or backend to other pieces of
      software.  For a listing of many third-party tools that are using
      Subversion functionality under-the-hood, check out the Links page on the
      Subversion website (<ulink
        url="http://subversion.tigris.org/project_links.html"/>).</para>
