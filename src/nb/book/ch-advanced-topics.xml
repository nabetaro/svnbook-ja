    <title>Peg and Operative Revisions</title>

    <para>We make use of the ability to copy, move, rename, and
      completely replace files and directories on our computers all
      the time.  And your version control system shouldn't get in the
      way of your doing these things with your version-controlled
      files and directories, either.  Subversion's file management
      support is quite liberating, affording almost as much
      flexibility for versioned files as you'd expect when
      manipulating your unversioned ones.  But that flexibility means
      that across the lifetime of your repository, a given versioned
      resource might have many paths, and a given path might represent
      several entirely different versioned resources.  And this
      introduces a certain level of complexity to your interactions
      with those paths and resources.</para>

    <para>Subversion is pretty smart about noticing when an object's
      version history includes such <quote>changes of address</quote>.
      For example, if you ask for the revision history log of a
      particular file that was renamed last week, Subversion happily
      provides all those logs&mdash;the revision in which the rename
      itself happened, plus the logs of relevant revisions both before
      and after that rename.  So, most of the time, you don't even
      have to think about such things.  But occasionally, Subversion
      needs your help to clear up ambiguities.</para>

    <para>The simplest example of this occurs when a directory or file
      is deleted from version control, and then a new directory or
      file is created with the same name and added to version control.
      Clearly the thing you deleted and the thing you later added
      aren't the same thing.  They merely happen to have had the same
      path, <filename>/trunk/object</filename> for example.  What,
      then, does it mean to ask Subversion about the history of
      <filename>/trunk/object</filename>?  Are you asking about the
      thing currently at that location, or the old thing you deleted
      from that location?  Are you asking about the operations that
      have happened to <emphasis>all</emphasis> the objects that have
      ever lived at that path?  Clearly, Subversion needs a hint about
      what you really want.</para>

    <para>And thanks to moves, versioned resource history can get far
      more twisted than that, even.  For example, you might have a
      directory named <filename>concept</filename>, containing some
      nascent software project you've been toying with.  Eventually,
      though, that project matures to the point that the idea seems to
      actually have some wings, so you do the unthinkable and decide
      to give the project a name.
      <footnote>
        <para><quote>You're not supposed to name it.  Once you name it,
          you start getting attached to it.</quote> &mdash; Mike
          Wazowski</para>
      </footnote>
      Let's say you called your software Frabnaggilywort.  At this
      point, it makes sense to rename the directory to reflect the
      project's new name, so <filename>concept</filename> is renamed
      to <filename>frabnaggilywort</filename>.  Life goes on,
      Frabnaggilywort releases a 1.0 version, and is downloaded and
      used daily by hordes of people aiming to improve their
      lives.</para>
    
    <para>It's a nice story, really, but it doesn't end there.
      Entrepreneur that you are, you've already got another think in
      the tank.  So you make a new directory,
      <filename>concept</filename>, and the cycle begins again.  In
      fact, the cycle begins again many times over the years, each
      time starting with that old <filename>concept</filename>
      directory, then sometimes seeing that directory renamed as the
      idea cures, sometimes seeing it deleted when you scrap the idea.
      Or, to get really sick, maybe you rename
      <filename>concept</filename> to something else for a while, but
      later rename the thing back to <filename>concept</filename> for
      some reason.</para>

    <para>When scenarios like these occur, attempting to instruct
      Subversion to work with these re-used paths can be a little like
      instructing a motorist in Chicago's West Suburbs to drive east
      down Roosevelt Road and turn left onto Main Street.  In a mere
      twenty minutes, you can cross <quote>Main Street</quote> in
      Wheaton, Glen Ellyn, and Lombard.  And no, they aren't the same
      street.  Our motorist&mdash;and our Subversion&mdash;need a
      little more detail in order to do the right thing.</para>

    <para>In version 1.1, Subversion introduced a way for you to tell
      it exactly which Main Street you meant.  It's called the
      <firstterm>peg revision</firstterm>, and it is a revision
      provided to Subversion for the sole purpose of identifying a
      unique line of history.  Because at most one versioned resource
      may occupy a path at any given time&mdash;or, more precisely, in
      any one revision&mdash;the combination of a path and a peg
      revision is all that is needed to refer to a specific line of
      history.  Peg revisions are specified to the Subversion
      command-line client using <firstterm>at syntax</firstterm>, so
      called because the syntax involves appending an <quote>at
      sign</quote> (<literal>@</literal>) and the peg revision to the
      end of the path with which the revision is associated.</para>

    <para>But what of the <option>--revision (-r)</option> of which
      we've spoken so much in this book?  That revision (or set of
      revisions) is called the <firstterm>operative
      revision</firstterm> (or <firstterm>operative revision
      range</firstterm>).  Once a particular line of history has been
      identified using a path and peg revision, Subversion performs
      the requested operation using the operative revision(s).  To map
      this to our Chicagoland streets analogy, if we are told to go to
      606 N. Main Street in Wheaton,
      <footnote>
        <para>606 N. Main Street, Wheaton, Illinois, is the home of
          the Wheaton History Center.  Get it&mdash;<quote>History
          Center</quote>?  It seemed appropriate&hellip;.</para>
      </footnote>
      we can think of <quote>Main Street</quote> as our path and
      <quote>Wheaton</quote> as our peg revision.  These two pieces of
      information identify a unique path which can travelled (north or
      south on Main Street), and will keep us from travelling up and
      down the wrong Main Street in search of our destination.  Now we
      throw in <quote>606 N.</quote> as our operative revision, of
      sorts, and we know <emphasis>exactly</emphasis> where to
      go.</para>

    <sidebar>
      <title>The "peg-revision" algorithm</title>
      
      <para>The Subversion command-line performs the peg-revision
        algorithm basically any time it needs to resolve possible
        ambiguities in the paths and revisions provided to it.  Here's
        an example of such an invocation for the purposes of
        illustrating that algorithm.</para>

      <screen>
$ svn <replaceable>command</replaceable> -r <replaceable>OPERATIVE-REV</replaceable> item@<replaceable>PEG-REV</replaceable>
</screen>
      
      <para>The algorithm has three simple steps:</para>

      <itemizedlist>
        
        <listitem>
          <para>Locate <replaceable>item</replaceable> in the revision
            identified by <replaceable>PEG-REV</replaceable>.  There
            can be only one such object.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>Trace the object's history backwards (through any
            possible renames) to its ancestor in the
            revision <replaceable>OPERATIVE-REV</replaceable>.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>Perform the requested action on that ancestor,
            wherever it is located, or whatever its name might
            be or have been at that time.</para>
        </listitem>

      </itemizedlist>

      <para>Note that even when you don't explicitly supply a peg
        revision or operative revision, they are still present.  For
        your convenience, the default peg revision is
        <literal>BASE</literal> for working copy items and
        <literal>HEAD</literal> for repository URLs.  And when no
        operative revision is provided, it defaults to being the same
        revision as the peg revision.</para>
        
    </sidebar>

    <para>Say that long ago we created our repository, and in revision 1
      added our first <filename>concept</filename> directory, plus an
      <filename>IDEA</filename> file in that directory talking about
      the concept.  After several revisions in which real code was
      added and tweaked, we, in revision 20, renamed this directory to
      <filename>frabnaggilywort</filename>.  By revision 27, we had a
      new concept, a new <filename>concept</filename> directory to
      hold it, and a new <filename>IDEA</filename> file to describe
      it.  And then five years and twenty thousand revisions flew by,
      just like they would in any good romance story.</para>

    <para>Now, years later, we wonder what the
      <filename>IDEA</filename> file looked like back in revision 1.
      But Subversion needs to know if we are asking about how the
      <emphasis>current</emphasis> file looked back in revision 1, or
      are we asking for the contents of whatever file lived at
      <filename>concepts/IDEA</filename> in revision 1?  Certainly
      those questions have different answers, and because of peg
      revisions, you can ask either of them.  To find out how the
      current <filename>IDEA</filename> file looked in that old
      revision, you run:</para>

    <screen>
$ svn cat -r 1 concept/IDEA 
subversion/libsvn_client/ra.c:775: (apr_err=20014)
svn: Unable to find repository location for 'concept/IDEA' in revision 1
</screen>

    <para>Of course, in this example, the current
      <filename>IDEA</filename> file didn't exist yet in revision 1,
      so Subversion gives an error.  The command above is shorthand
      for a longer notation which explicitly lists a peg revision.
      The expanded notation is:</para>

    <screen>
$ svn cat -r 1 concept/IDEA@BASE
subversion/libsvn_client/ra.c:775: (apr_err=20014)
svn: Unable to find repository location for 'concept/IDEA' in revision 1
</screen>

    <para>And when executed, it has the expected results.  Peg revisions
      generally default to a value of <literal>BASE</literal> (the
      revision currently present in the working copy) when applied to
      working copy paths, and of <literal>HEAD</literal> when applied
      to URLs.</para>

    <para>The perceptive reader is probably wondering at this point if
      the peg revision syntax causes problems for working copy paths
      or URLs that actually have ampersand characters in them.  After
      all, how does <command>svn</command> know whether
      <literal>news@11</literal> is the name of a directory in my
      tree, or just a syntax for <quote>revision 11 of
      <filename>news</filename></quote>?  Thankfully, while
      <command>svn</command> will always assume the latter, there is a
      trivial workaround.  You need only append an ampersand to the
      end of the path, such as <literal>news@11@</literal>.
      <command>svn</command> only cares about the last ampersand in
      the argument, and it is not considered illegal to omit a literal
      peg revision specifier after that ampersand.  This workaround
      even applies to paths that end in an ampersand&mdash;you would
      use <literal>filename@@</literal> to talk about a file named
      <filename>filename@</filename>.</para>

    <para>Let's ask the other question, then&mdash;in revision 1, what
      were the contents of whatever file occupied the address
      <filename>concepts/IDEA</filename> at the time?  We'll use an
      explicit peg revision to help us out.</para>

    <screen>
$ svn cat concept/IDEA@1
The idea behind this project is to come up with a piece of software
that can frab a naggily wort.  Frabbing naggily worts is tricky
business, and doing it incorrectly can have serious ramifications, so
we need to employ over-the-top input validation and data verification
mechanisms.
</screen>

    <para>Notice that we didn't provide an operative revision this
      time.  That's because when no operative revision is specified,
      Subversion assumes a default operative revision that's the same
      as the peg revision.</para>

    <para>As you can see, the output from our operation appears to be
      correct.  The text even mentions frabbing naggily worts, so this
      is almost certainly the file which describes the software now
      called Frabnaggilywort.  In fact, we can verify this using the
      combination of an explicit peg revision and explicit operative
      revision.  We know that in <literal>HEAD</literal>, the
      Frabnaggilywort project is located in the
      <filename>frabnaggilywort</filename> directory.  So we specify
      that we want to see how the line of history identified in
      <literal>HEAD</literal> as the path
      <filename>frabnaggilywort/IDEA</filename> looked in revision
      1.</para>

    <screen>
$ svn cat -r 1 frabnaggilywort/IDEA@HEAD
The idea behind this project is to come up with a piece of software

we need to employ over-the-top input validation and data verification

</screen>

    <para>And the peg and operative revisions need not be so trivial,
      either.  For example, say <filename>frabnaggilywort</filename>
      had been deleted from <literal>HEAD</literal>, but we know it
      existed in revision 20, and we want to see the diffs for its
      <filename>IDEA</filename> file between revisions 4 and 10.  We
      can use the peg revision 20 in conjunction with the URL that
      would have held Frabnaggilywort's <filename>IDEA</filename> file
      in revision 20, and then use 4 and 10 as our operative revision
      range.</para>

    <para>In addition to versioning your directories and files,
      Subversion provides interfaces for adding, modifying, and

      <firstterm>properties</firstterm>, and they can be thought of as
      two-column tables that map property names to arbitrary values

      the names and values of the properties can be whatever you want
      them to be, with the constraint that the names must be
      human-readable text.  And the best part about these properties
      is that they, too, are versioned, just like the textual contents
      of your files.  You can modify, commit, and revert property

    <para>I tillegg til å versjonere kataloger og filer, har Subversion 
      grensesnitt for å legge til, forandre og fjerne versjonerte

      Vi refererer til disse metadataene som 
      <firstterm>egenskaper</firstterm> (engelsk: 
      <foreignphrase>properties</foreignphrase>), og du kan tenke på dem 
      som en tabell med to kolonner som forbinder egenskapsnavn med 
      vilkårlige verdier som ligger sammen med hvert element i 
      arbeidskopien din.
      Generelt sett kan navnene og verdiene til egenskapene være hva du 
      vil at de skal være, med den begrensningen at navnene må være 
      lesbar for mennesker.
      Og det beste med disse egenskapene er at de også er versjonerte, 
      akkurat som det tekstbaserte innholdet i filene dine.
      Du kan forandre, legge inn og reversere egenskapsforandringer like 
      lett som å legge inn forandringer i innhold.
      Og sending og henting av egenskapsforandringer blir en del av dine 
      vanlige innleggingsoperasjoner – du trenger ikke å forandre på

    <para>Properties show up elsewhere in Subversion, too.  Just as

      arbitrary properties attached to it.  The same constraints
      apply&mdash;human-readable names and anything-you-want binary
      values.  The main difference is that revision properties are not
      versioned.  In other words, if you change the value of, or

      Subversion's functionality to recover the previous value.</para>

      for mennesker, men verdiene kan være binære og alt hva du vil.
      Hovedforskjellen er at revisjonsegenskaper ikke er versjonerte.
      Med andre ord, hvis du forandrer verdien på, eller sletter, en

      Og Subversion bruker faktisk egenskaper, både av den versjonerte 
      og uversjonerte typen.
      Enkelte versjonerte egenskaper har spesiell betydning eller effekt 
      når de brukes på filer og kataloger, eller lagrer spesiell 
      informasjon om revisjonene de finnes i.
      Enkelte revisjonsegenskaper legges automatisk til revisjoner av 
      innleggingsprosessen, og inneholder informasjon om revisjonen.
      Mesteparten av disse egenskapene er nevnt andre steder andre 
      steder i dette eller andre kapitler som del av de mer generelle 
      emnene de hører til.

        for displaying the names and values of properties stored on
        files and directories.  The <command>svn proplist</command>
        command will list the names of properties that exist on a
        path.  Once you know the names of the properties on the node,
        you can request their values individually using <command>svn
        propget</command>.  This command will, given a path (or set of
        paths) and a property name, print the value of the property to
        the standard output stream.</para>

      <para>Alt dette med å legge til og redigere egenskaper hadde 
        egentlig ikke vært særlig nyttig hvis du ikke hadde hatt en måte 
        å få tak i den lagrede egenskapsverdien.
        Til dette har <command>svn</command>-programmet to delkommandoer 
        for å vise navnene og verdiene til egenskaper som er lagret i 
        filer og kataloger.
        Kommandoen <command>svn proplist</command> vil liste ut navnene 
        på egenskapene som eksisterer i en sti.
        Når du vet navnene til egenskapene på noden, kan du be om 
        verdiene individuelt ved å bruke <command>svn propget</command>.
        Denne kommandoen vil, når den får en sti (eller sett av stier) 
        og et egenskapsnavn, skrive verdien av egenskapen til standard 
        ut-strømmen.</para>

      <para>Now that you are familiar with all of the
        property-related <command>svn</command> subcommands, let's see
        how property modifications affect the usual Subversion
        workflow.  As we mentioned earlier, file and directory
        properties are versioned, just like your file contents.  As a
        result, Subversion provides the same opportunities for
        merging&mdash;in cleanly or conflicting fashions&mdash;someone
        else's modifications into your own.</para>
      @ENGLISH }}} -->
      <para>Nå som du er kjent med alle 
        <command>svn</command>-kommandoene som er relatert til 
        egenskaper, la oss se hvordan forandringer i egenskaper påvirker 
        den vanlige arbeidsflyten i Subversion.
        Som vi nevnte tidligere, er fil- og katalogegenskaper 
        versjonerte, akkurat som innholdet i filene dine.
        Dette betyr at Subversion har de samme mulighetene for fletting 
        – med dertil potensielle konflikter – av andres forandringer inn 
        i dine egne.</para>

      <!-- @ENGLISH {{{
      <para>And as with file contents, your property changes are local
        modifications, only made permanent when you commit them to the
        repository with <command>svn commit</command>.  Your property
        changes can be easily unmade, too&mdash;the <command>svn
        revert</command> command will restore your files and
        directories to their un-edited states, contents, properties,
        and all.  Also, you can receive interesting information about
        the state of your file and directory properties by using the
        <command>svn status</command> and <command>svn diff</command>
        commands.</para>
      @ENGLISH }}} -->
      <para>Og i likhet med filinnhold, er forandringene dine i 
        egenskapene lokale modifiseringer som kun blir gjort permanente 
        når du legger dem inn i depotet med <command>svn 
        commit</command>.
        Egenskapsforandringene kan lett omgjøres – kommandoen 
        <command>svn revert</command> vil sette filene og katalogene 
        dine tilbake til den uredigerte tilstanden – innhold, 
        egenskaper, alt.
        Du kan også få interessant informasjon om tilstanden til fil- og 
        katalogegenskapene ved å bruke kommandoene <command>svn

      <title>Automatic Property Setting</title>

      <para>Properties are a powerful feature of Subversion, acting as
        key components of many Subversion features discussed elsewhere
        in this and other chapters&mdash;textual diff and merge
        support, keyword substitution, newline translation, etc.  But
        to get the full benefit of properties, they must be set on the
        right files and directories.  Unfortunately, that can be a
        step easily forgotten in the routine of things, especially
        since failing to set a property doesn't usually result in an
        obvious error condition (at least compared to, say, failing to
        add a file to version control).  To help your properties get
        applied to the places that need them, Subversion provides a
        couple of simple but useful features.</para>

      <para>Whenever you introduce a file to version control using the
        <command>svn add</command> or <command>svn import</command>
        commands, Subversion tries to assist by setting some common
        file properties automatically.  First, on operating systems
        whose filesystems support an execute permission bit,
        Subversion will automatically set the
        <literal>svn:executable</literal> property on newly added or
        imported files whose execute bit is enabled.  (See <xref
        linkend="svn.advanced.props.special.executable" /> for more
        about this property.)  Secondly, it runs a very basic
        heuristic to determine if that file contains human-readable
        content.  If not, Subversion will automatically set the
        <literal>svn:mime-type</literal> property on that file to
        <literal>application/octet-stream</literal> (the generic
        <quote>this is a collection of bytes</quote> MIME type).  Of
        course, if Subversion guesses incorrectly, or if you wish to
        set the <literal>svn:mime-type</literal> property to something
        more precise&mdash;perhaps <literal>image/png</literal> or
        <literal>application/x-shockwave-flash</literal>&mdash;you can
        always remove or edit that property.  (For more on
        Subversion's use of MIME types, see <xref
        linkend="svn.advanced.props.special.mime-type" />.)</para>

      <para>Subversion also provides, via its runtime configuration
        system, a more flexible automatic property setting feature
        which allows you to create mappings of filename patterns to
        property names and values.  Once again, these mappings affect
        adds and imports, and not only can override the default MIME
        type decision made by Subversion during those operations, but
        can also set additional Subversion or custom properties, too.
        For example, you might create a mapping that says that any
        time you add JPEG files&mdash;ones that match the pattern
        <literal>*.jpg</literal>&mdash;Subversion should automatically
        set the <literal>svn:mime-type</literal> property on those
        files to <literal>image/jpeg</literal>.  Or perhaps any files
        that match <literal>*.cpp</literal> should have
        <literal>svn:eol-style</literal> set to
        <literal>native</literal>, and <literal>svn:keywords</literal>
        set to <literal>Id</literal>.  Auto-prop support is perhaps
        the handiest property related tool in the Subversion toolbox.
        See <xref linkend="svn.advanced.confarea.opts.config"/> for
        more about configuring that support.</para>

    <title>File Portability</title>

    <para>Fortunately for Subversion users who routinely find
      themselves on different computers with different operating
      systems, Subversion's command-line programs almost universally
      behave identically across all those systems.  If you know how to
      wield <command>svn</command> on one platform, you know how to
      wield it everywhere.</para>

    <para>However, the same is not always true of other general classes
      of software, or of the actual files you keep in Subversion.  For
      example, on a Windows machine, the definition of a <quote>text
      file</quote> would be similar to that used on a Linux box, but
      with a key difference&mdash;the character sequences used to mark
      the ends of the lines of those files.  There are other
      differences, too.  Unix platforms have (and Subversion supports)
      symbolic links; Windows does not.  Unix platforms use filesystem
      permission to determine executability; Windows uses filename
      extensions.</para>

    <para>Because Subversion is in no position to unite the whole
      world in common definitions and implementations of all of these
      things, the best it can do is to try to help make your life
      simpler when you need to work with your versioned files and
      directories on multiple computers and operating systems.  This
      section describes some of the ways Subversion does this.</para>

    <!-- =============================================================== -->
    <sect2 id="svn.advanced.props.special.mime-type">
      <title>File Content Type</title>
      
      <para>Software programs on most modern operating systems make
        assumptions about the type and format of the contents of a
        file by the file's name, specifically its file extension.  For
        example, files whose names end in <filename>.txt</filename>
        are generally assumed to be human-readable, able to be
        understood by simple perusal rather than requiring complex
        processing to decipher.  Files whose names end in
        <filename>.png</filename>, on the other hand, are assumed to
        be of the Portable Network Graphics type&mdash;not
        human-readable at all, and sensible only when interpreted by
        software which understands the PNG format and can render the
        information in that format as a raster image.</para>

      <para>Unfortunately, some of those extensions have changed
        meanings over time.  When personal computers first appeared, a
        file named <filename>README.DOC</filename> would have almost
        certainly been a plaintext file, just like today's
        <filename>.txt</filename> files.  But by the mid-1990's,
        you could almost bet that a file of that name would not be a
        plaintext file at all, but instead a Microsoft Word document
        with a proprietary, non-human-readable format.  But this
        change didn't occur overnight&mdash;there was certainly a
        period of confusion for computer users over what exactly they
        had in hand when they saw a <filename>.DOC</filename> file.
        <footnote>
          <para>You think that was rough?  During that same era,
            WordPerfect also used <filename>.DOC</filename> for their
            proprietary file format's preferred extension!</para>
        </footnote>
      </para>

      <para>The popularity of computer networking cast still more
        doubt on the mapping between a file's name and its content.
        With information being served across networks and generated
        dynamically by server-side scripts, there was often no real
        file <foreignphrase>per se</foreignphrase> to speak of, and
        therefore no file name.  Web servers, for example, needed some
        other way to tell browsers what they were downloading so the
        browser could do something intelligent with that information,
        whether that was to display the data using a program
        registered to handle that data type, or to prompt the user for
        where on the client machine to store the downloaded
        data.</para>

      <para>Eventually, a standard emerged for, among other things,
        describing the contents of a data stream.  In 1996, RFC2045
        was published, the first of five RFCs describing Multipurpose
        Internet Mail Extensions (MIME).  In it, this RFC describes
        the concept of media types and subtypes, and recommends a
        syntax for the representation of those types.  Today, MIME
        media types&mdash;or, MIME types&mdash; are used almost
        universally across e-mail applications, Web servers, and other
        software as the <foreignphrase>de facto</foreignphrase>
        mechanism for clearing up the file content confusion.</para>

      <para>Subversion joins the ranks of applications which recognize
        and make use of MIME types.  Besides being a general-purpose
        storage location for a file's content type, the value of the
        <literal>svn:mime-type</literal> file property determines some
        behavioral characteristics of Subversion itself.</para>

      <para>For example, one of the benefits that Subversion typically
        provides is contextual, line-based merging of changes received
        from the server during an update into your working file.  But
        for files containing non-textual data, there is often no
        concept of a <quote>line</quote>.  So, for versioned files
        whose <literal>svn:mime-type</literal> property is set to a
        non-textual MIME type (generally, something that doesn't begin
        with <literal>text/</literal>, though there are exceptions),
        Subversion does not attempt to perform contextual merges
        during updates.  Instead, any time you have locally modified a
        binary working copy file that is also being updated, your file
        is renamed with a <filename>.orig</filename> extension, and
        then Subversion stores a new working copy file that contains
        the changes received during the update, but not your own local
        modifications, at the original filename.  This behavior is
        really for the protection of the user against failed attempts
        at performing contextual merges on files that simply cannot be
        contextually merged.</para>

      <para>Also, if the <literal>svn:mime-type</literal> property is
        set, then the Subversion Apache module will use its value to
        populate the <literal>Content-type:</literal> HTTP header when
        responding to GET requests.  This gives your web browser a
        crucial clue about how to display a file when using it to
        peruse your Subversion repository's contents.</para>

    <sect2 id="svn.advanced.props.special.executable">
      <title>File Executability</title>
 
      <para>On many operating systems, the ability to execute a file
        as a command is governed by the presence of an execute
        permission bit.  This bit usually defaults to being disabled,
        and must be explicitly enabled by the user for each file that
        needs it.  But it would be a monumental hassle to have to
        remember exactly which files in freshly checked-out working
        copy were supposed to have their executable bits toggled on,
        and then to have to do that toggling.  So, Subversion provides
        the <literal>svn:executable</literal> property as a way to
        specify that the executable bit for the file on which that
        property is set should be enabled, and Subversion honors that
        request when populating working copies with such files.</para>

      <para>This property has no effect on filesystems that have no
        concept of an executable permission bit, such as FAT32 and
        NTFS.
        <footnote>
          <para>The Windows filesystems use file extensions (such as
            <literal>.EXE</literal>, <literal>.BAT</literal>, and
            <literal>.COM</literal>) to denote executable
            files.</para>
        </footnote>
        Also, although it has no defined values, Subversion will force
        its value to <literal>*</literal> when setting this property.
        Finally, this property is valid only on files, not on
        directories.</para>

    </sect2>

    <!-- =============================================================== -->
    <sect2 id="svn.advanced.props.special.eol-style">
      <title>End-of-Line Character Sequences</title>

      <para>Unless otherwise noted using a versioned file's
        <literal>svn:mime-type</literal> property, Subversion
        assumes the file contains human-readable data.  Generally
        speaking, Subversion only uses this knowledge to determine
        if contextual difference reports for that file are
        possible.  Otherwise, to Subversion, bytes are bytes.</para>
      
      <para>This means that by default, Subversion doesn't pay any
        attention to the type of <firstterm>end-of-line (EOL)
        markers</firstterm> used in your files.  Unfortunately,
        different operating systems have different conventions about
        which character sequences represent the end of a line of text
        in a file.  For example, the usual line ending token used by
        software on the Windows platform is a pair of ASCII control
        characters&mdash;a carriage return (<literal>CR</literal>)
        followed by a line feed (<literal>LF</literal>).  Unix
        software, however, just uses the <literal>LF</literal>
        character to denote the end of a line.</para>

      <para>Not all of the various tools on these operating systems
        are prepared to understand files that contain line endings
        in a format that differs from the <firstterm>native line
        ending style</firstterm> of the operating system on which
        they are running.  Common results are that Unix programs
        treat the <literal>CR</literal> character present in Windows
        files as a regular character (usually rendered as
        <literal>^M</literal>), and that Windows programs combine
        all of the lines of a Unix file into one giant line because
        no carriage return-linefeed (or <literal>CRLF</literal>)
        character combination was found to denote the end of
        line.</para>

      <para>This sensitivity to foreign EOL markers can become
        frustrating for folks who share a file across different
        operating systems.  For example, consider a source code
        file, and developers that edit this file on both Windows and
        Unix systems.  If all the developers always use tools which
        preserve the line ending style of the file, no problems
        occur.</para>

      <para>But in practice, many common tools either fail to
        properly read a file with foreign EOL markers, or they
        convert the file's line endings to the native style when the
        file is saved.  If the former is true for a developer, he
        has to use an external conversion utility (such as
        <command>dos2unix</command> or its companion,
        <command>unix2dos</command>) to prepare the file for
        editing.  The latter case requires no extra preparation.
        But both cases result in a file that differs from the
        original quite literally on every line!  Prior to committing
        his changes, the user has two choices.  Either he can use a
        conversion utility to restore the modified file to the same
        line ending style that it was in before his edits were made.
        Or, he can simply commit the file&mdash;new EOL markers and
        all.</para>

      <para>The result of scenarios like these include wasted time
        and unnecessary modifications to committed files.  Wasted
        time is painful enough.  But when commits change every line
        in a file, this complicates the job of determining which of
        those lines were changed in a non-trivial way.  Where was
        that bug really fixed?  On what line was a syntax error
        introduced?</para>

      <para>The solution to this problem is the
        <literal>svn:eol-style</literal> property.  When this
        property is set to a valid value, Subversion uses it to
        determine what special processing to perform on the file so
        that the file's line ending style isn't flip-flopping with
        every commit that comes from a different operating
        system.  The valid values are:</para>

      <variablelist>
        <varlistentry>
          <term><literal>native</literal></term>
          <listitem>
            <para>This causes the file to contain the EOL markers
              that are native to the operating system on which
              Subversion was run.  In other words, if a user on a
              Windows machine checks out a working copy that
              contains a file with an
              <literal>svn:eol-style</literal> property set to
              <literal>native</literal>, that file will contain
              <literal>CRLF</literal> EOL markers.  A Unix user
              checking out a working copy which contains the same
              file will see <literal>LF</literal> EOL markers in his
              copy of the file.</para>

            <para>Note that Subversion will actually store the file
              in the repository using normalized
              <literal>LF</literal> EOL markers regardless of the
              operating system.  This is basically transparent to

    <title>Selective Versioning</title>

    <para>In any given working copy there is a good chance that
      alongside all those versioned files and directories are other
      files and directories which are not, and are not intended to be,
      themselved versioned.  Text editors litter directories with
      backup files.  Code compilation processes generate
      intermediate&mdash;or even final&mdash;files which you typically
      wouldn't bother to version.  And users themselves drop various
      other files and directories wherever they see fit, often in
      version control working copies.</para>

    <para>It's ludicrous to expect Subversion working copies to be
      somehow impervious to this kind of clutter and impurity.  In
      fact, Subversion counts it as a <emphasis>feature</emphasis>
      that its working copies are just typical directories, just like
      unversioned trees.  But these not-to-be-versioned files and
      directories can cause some annoyance for Subversion users.  For
      example, because the <command>svn add</command> and <command>svn
      import</command> commands act recursively by default, and don't
      know which files in a given tree you do and don't wish to
      version, it's easy to accidentally add stuff to version control
      that you didn't mean to.  And because <command>svn
      status</command> reports, by default, every item of interest in
      a working copy&mdash;including unversioned files and
      directories&mdash;its output can get quite noisy where many of
      these things exist.</para>

    <para>So Subversion provides a pair of ways for telling it which
      files you would prefer that it simply disregard.  One of the
      ways involves the use of Subversion's runtime configuration
      system, and therefore applies to all the Subversion operations
      which make use of that runtime configuration, generally those
      performed on a particular computer, or by a particular user of a
      computer.  The other way makes use of Subversion's directory
      property support, is more tightly bound to the versioned tree
      itself, and therefore affects everyone who has a working copy of
      that tree.  Both of the mechanisms use file patterns.</para>

    <para>The Subversion runtime configuration system provides an
      option, <literal>global-ignores</literal>, whose value is a
      whitespace-delimited collection of file patterns (or globs).
      These patterns are applied to files which are candidates for
      addition to version control, as well as to unversioned files
      which the <command>svn status</command> command notices.  If the
      filenames match one of the patterns, Subversion will basically
      act as if the file didn't exist at all.  This is really useful
      for file patterns which are nearly universally of the variety
      that you don't want to version, such as editor backup files like
      Emacs' <literal>*~</literal> and <literal>.*~</literal>
      files.</para>

    <para>When found on a versioned directory, the
      <literal>svn:ignore</literal> property is expected to contain a
      list of newline-delimited file patterns which Subversion should
      use to determine ignorable objects in that same directory.
      These patterns do not override those found in the
      <literal>global-ignores</literal> runtime configuration option,
      but are instead appended to that list.  And it's worth noting
      again that, unlike the <literal>global-ignores</literal> option,
      the patterns found in the <literal>svn:eol-ignore</literal>
      property apply only to the directory on which that property is
      set, and not to any of its subdirectories.  The
      <literal>svn:ignore</literal> property is a good way to tell
      Subversion to ignore files that are likely to be present in
      every user's working copy of that directory, such as compiler
      output or&mdash;to use an example more appropriate to this
      book&mdash;the HTML, PDF, or PostScript files generated as the
      result of a conversion of some source DocBook XML files to a
      more legible output format.</para>

    <warning>
      <para>Subversion's support for ignorable file patterns extends
        only to the one-time process of adding unversioned
        files and directories to version control.  Once an object is
        under Subversion's watchkeep, the ignore pattern mechanisms no
        longer apply to it.  In other words, don't expect Subversion
        to avoid committing changes you've made to a versioned file
        simply because that file's name matches an ignore
        pattern&mdash;Subversion <emphasis>always</emphasis> notices
        all of its versioned resources.</para>

      <title>Ignore Patterns for CVS Users</title>
    
      <para>The Subversion <literal>svn:ignore</literal> property is
        very similar in syntax and function to the CVS
        <filename>.cvsignore</filename> file.  In fact, if you are
        migrating a CVS working copy to Subversion, you can directly
        migrate the ignore patterns by using the
        <filename>.cvsignore</filename> file as input file to the
        <command>svn propset</command> command:</para>
   
      <screen>
$ svn propset svn:ignore -F .cvsignore .
property 'svn:ignore' set on '.'
$
</screen>        
    
      <para>There are, however, some differences in the ways that CVS
        and Subversion handle ignore patterns.  The two systems use
        the ignore patterns at some different times, and there are
        slight discrepancies in what the ignore patterns apply to.
        Also, Subversion does not recognize the use of the
        <literal>!</literal> pattern as a reset back to having no
        ignore patterns at all.</para>

    </sidebar>

    <para>The global list of ignore patterns tends to be more a
      matter of personal taste, and tied more closely to a user's
      particular tool chain than to the details of any particular
      working copy's needs.  So, the rest of this section will focus
      on the <literal>svn:ignore</literal> property and its
      uses.</para>

    <para>Say you have the following output from <command>svn
      status</command>:</para>

    <screen>
$ svn status calc
 M     calc/button.c
?      calc/calculator
?      calc/data.c
?      calc/debug_log
?      calc/debug_log.1
?      calc/debug_log.2.gz
?      calc/debug_log.3.gz
</screen>
    
    <para>In this example, you have made some property modifications
      to <filename>button.c</filename>, but in your working copy you
      also have some unversioned files: the latest
      <filename>calculator</filename> program that you've compiled
      from your source code, a source file named
      <filename>data.c</filename>, and a set of debugging output log
      files.  Now, you know that your build system always results in
      the <filename>calculator</filename> program being generated.
      <footnote>
        <para>Isn't that the whole point of a build system?</para>
      </footnote>
      And you know that your test suite always leaves those debugging
      log files lying around.  These facts are true for all working
      copies of this project, not just your own.  And you know that
      you aren't interested in seeing those things every time you run
      <command>svn status</command>, and pretty sure that nobody else
      is interested in them either.  So you use <command>svn propedit
      svn:ignore calc</command> to add some ignore patterns to the
      <filename>calc</filename> directory.  For example, you might add
      this as the new value of the <literal>svn:ignore</literal>
      property:</para>

    <programlisting>
calculator
debug_log*
</programlisting>
    
    <para>After you've added this property, you will now have a local
      property modification on the <filename>calc</filename>
      directory.  But notice what else is different about your
      <command>svn status</command> output:</para>

    <screen>
$ svn status
 M     calc
 M     calc/button.c
?      calc/data.c
</screen>
    
    <para>Now, all that cruft is missing from the output!  Of course,
      your <filename>calculator</filename> compiled program and all
      those logfiles are still in your working copy.  Subversion is
      simply not reminding you that they are present and unversioned.
      And now with all the uninteresting noise removed from the
      display, you are left with more interesting items&mdash;such as
      that source code file <filename>data.c</filename> that you
      probably forgot to add to version control.</para>

    <para>Of course, this less-verbose report of your working copy
      status isn't the only one available.  If you actually want to
      see the ignored files as part of the status report, you can pass
      the <option>--no-ignore</option> option to Subversion:</para>

    <screen>
$ svn status --no-ignore
 M     calc/button.c
I      calc/calculator
?      calc/data.c
I      calc/debug_log
I      calc/debug_log.1
I      calc/debug_log.2.gz
I      calc/debug_log.3.gz
</screen>
    
    <para>As mentioned earlier, the list of file patterns to ignore is
      also used by <command>svn add</command> and <command>svn
      import</command>.  Both of these operations involve asking
      Subversion to begin managing some set of files and directories.
      Rather than force the user to pick and choose which files in a
      tree she wishes to start versioning, Subversion uses the ignore
      patterns&mdash;both the global and the per-directory
      lists&mdash;to determine which files should not be swept into
      the version control system as part of a larger recursive
      addition or import operation.  And here again, you can use the
      <option>--no-ignore</option> option to tell Subversion ignore
      its ignores list and operate on all the files and directories
      present.</para>

    <title>Keyword Substitution</title>

    <para>Subversion has the ability to substitute
      <firstterm>keywords</firstterm>&mdash;pieces of useful,
      dynamic information about a versioned file&mdash;into the
      contents of the file itself.  Keywords generally describe
      information about the last time the file was known to be
      modified.  Because this information changes each time the
      file changes, and more importantly, just
      <emphasis>after</emphasis> the file changes, it is a hassle
      for any process except the version control system to keep
      the data completely up-to-date.  Left to human authors, the
      information would inevitably grow stale.</para>

    <para>For example, say you have a document in which you would
      like to display the last date on which it was modified.  You
      could burden every author of that document to, just before
      committing their changes, also tweak the part of the
      document that describes when it was last changed.  But
      sooner or later, someone would forget to do that.  Instead
      simply ask Subversion to perform keyword substitution on the
      <literal>LastChangedDate</literal> keyword.  You control
      where the keyword is inserted into your document by placing
      a <firstterm>keyword anchor</firstterm> at the desired
      location in the file.  This anchor is just a string of text
      formatted as
      <literal>$</literal><replaceable>KeywordName</replaceable><literal>$</literal>.</para>

    <para>All keywords are case-sensitive where they appear as
      anchors in files: you must use the correct capitalization in
      order for the keyword to be expanded.  You should consider the
      value of the <literal>svn:keywords</literal> property to be
      case-sensitive too&mdash;certain keyword names will be recognized
      regardless of case, but this behavior is deprecated.</para>

    <para>Subversion defines the list of keywords available for
      substitution.  That list contains the following five keywords, 
      some of which have aliases that you can also use:</para>

    <variablelist>
      <varlistentry>
        <term><literal>Date</literal></term>
        <listitem>
          <para>This keyword describes the last time the file was
            known to have been changed in the repository, and
            looks something like <literal>$Date:
            2002-07-22 21:42:37 -0700 (Mon, 22 Jul 2002)
            $</literal>.  It may also be specified as
            <literal>LastChangedDate</literal>.</para>
        </listitem>
      </varlistentry>
      <varlistentry>
        <term><literal>Revision</literal></term>
        <listitem>
          <para>This keyword describes the last known revision in
            which this file changed in the repository, and looks
            something like <literal>$Revision: 144 $</literal>.  
            It may also be specified as
            <literal>LastChangedRevision</literal> or
            <literal>Rev</literal>.</para>
        </listitem>
      </varlistentry>
      <varlistentry>
        <term><literal>Author</literal></term>
        <listitem>
          <para>This keyword describes the last known user to
            change this file in the repository, and looks
            something like <literal>$Author: harry $</literal>.  
            It may also be specified as 
            <literal>LastChangedBy</literal>.</para>
        </listitem>
      </varlistentry>
      <varlistentry>
        <term><literal>HeadURL</literal></term>
        <listitem>
          <para>This keyword describes the full URL to the latest
            version of the file in the repository, and looks
            something like <literal>$HeadURL:
            http://svn.collab.net/repos/trunk/README $</literal>.
            It may be abbreviated as
            <literal>URL</literal>.</para>
        </listitem>
      </varlistentry>
      <varlistentry>
        <term><literal>Id</literal></term>
        <listitem>
          <para>This keyword is a compressed combination of the
            other keywords.  Its substitution looks something like
            <literal>$Id: calc.c 148 2002-07-28 21:30:43Z sally
            $</literal>, and is interpreted to mean that the file
            <filename>calc.c</filename> was last changed in revision
            148 on the evening of July 28, 2002 by the user
            <literal>sally</literal>.</para>
        </listitem>
      </varlistentry>
    </variablelist>

    <para>Simply adding keyword anchor text to your file does
      nothing special.  Subversion will never attempt to perform
      textual substitutions on your file contents unless
      explicitly asked to do so.  After all, you might be writing
      a document
      <footnote>
        <para>&hellip; or maybe even a section of a book &hellip;</para>
      </footnote> 
      about how to use keywords, and you don't want Subversion to
      substitute your beautiful examples of un-substituted keyword
      anchors!</para>

    <para>To tell Subversion whether or not to substitute keywords
      on a particular file, we again turn to the property-related
      subcommands.  The <literal>svn:keywords</literal> property,
      when set on a versioned file, controls which keywords will
      be substituted on that file.  The value is a space-delimited
      list of the keyword names or aliases found in the previous
      table.</para>

    <para>For example, say you have a versioned file named
      <filename>weather.txt</filename> that looks like
      this:</para>

    <programlisting>
Here is the latest report from the front lines.
$LastChangedDate$
$Rev$
Cumulus clouds are appearing more frequently as summer approaches.
</programlisting>
        
    <para>With no <literal>svn:keywords</literal> property set on
      that file, Subversion will do nothing special.  Now, let's
      enable substitution of the
      <literal>LastChangedDate</literal> keyword.</para>

    <screen>
$ svn propset svn:keywords "Date Author" weather.txt
property 'svn:keywords' set on 'weather.txt'
$
</screen>        
    
    <para>Now you have made a local property modification on the
      <filename>weather.txt</filename> file.  You will see no
      changes to the file's contents (unless you made some of your
      own prior to setting the property).  Notice that the file
      contained a keyword anchor for the <literal>Rev</literal>
      keyword, yet we did not include that keyword in the property
      value we set.  Subversion will happily ignore requests to
      substitute keywords that are not present in the file, and
      will not substitute keywords that are not present in the
      <literal>svn:keywords</literal> property value.</para>

    <sidebar>
      <title>Keywords and Spurious Differences</title>

      <para>The user-visible result of keyword substitution might
        lead you to think that every version of a file with that
        feature in use differs from the previous version in at
        least the area where the keyword anchor was placed.
        However, this is actually not the case.  While checking
        for local modifications during <command>svn
        diff</command>, and before transmitting those local
        modifications during <command>svn commit</command>,
        Subversion <quote>un-substitutes</quote> any keywords that
        it previously substituted.  The result is that the
        versions of the file that are stored in the repository
        contain only the real modifications that users make to the
        file.</para>

    </sidebar>

    <para>Immediately after you commit this property change,
      Subversion will update your working file with the new
      substitute text.  Instead of seeing your keyword anchor
      <literal>$LastChangedDate$</literal>, you'll see its
      substituted result.  That result also contains the name of
      the keyword, and continues to be bounded by the dollar sign
      (<literal>$</literal>) characters.  And as we predicted, the
      <literal>Rev</literal> keyword was not substituted because
      we didn't ask for it to be.</para>

    <para>Note also that we set the <literal>svn:keywords</literal>
      property to <quote>Date Author</quote> yet the keyword
      anchor used the alias <literal>$LastChangedDate$</literal>
      and still expanded correctly.</para>

    <screen>
Here is the latest report from the front lines.
$LastChangedDate: 2002-07-22 21:42:37 -0700 (Mon, 22 Jul 2002) $
$Rev$
Cumulus clouds are appearing more frequently as summer approaches.
</screen>
        
    <para>If someone else now commits a change to
      <filename>weather.txt</filename>, your copy of that file
      will continue to display the same substituted keyword value
      as before&mdash;until you update your working copy.  At that
      time the keywords in your <filename>weather.txt</filename>
      file will be re-substituted with information that
      reflects the most recent known commit to that file.</para>

    <para>Subversion 1.2 introduced a new variant of the keyword
      syntax which brought additional, useful&mdash;though perhaps
      atypical&mdash;functionality.  You can now tell Subversion
      to maintain a fixed length (in terms of the number of bytes
      consumed) for the substituted keyword.  By using a
      double-colon (<literal>::</literal>) after the keyword name,
      followed by a number of space characters, you define that
      fixed width.  When Subversion goes to substitute your
      keyword for the keyword and its value, it will essentially
      replace only those space characters, leaving the overall
      width of the keyword field unchanged.  If the substituted
      value is shorter than the defined field width, there will be
      extra padding characters (spaces) at the end of the
      substituted field; if it is too long, it is truncated with a
      special hash (<literal>#</literal>) character just before
      the final dollar sign terminator.</para>

    <para>For example, say you have a document in which you have
      some section of tabular data reflecting the document's
      Subversion keywords.  Using the original Subversion keyword
      substitution syntax, your file might look something
      like:</para>

    <screen>
$Rev$:     Revision of last commit
$Author$:  Author of last commit
$Date$:    Date of last commit
</screen>
    
    <para>Now, that looks nice and tabular at the start of things.
      But when you then commit that file (with keyword substitution
      enabled, of course), you see:</para>

    <screen>
$Rev: 12 $:     Revision of last commit
$Author: harry $:  Author of last commit
$Date: 2006-03-15 02:33:03 -0500 (Wed, 15 Mar 2006) $:    Date of last commit
</screen>
    
    <para>The result is not so beautiful.  And you might be
      tempted to then adjust the file after the substitution so
      that it again looks tabular.  But that only holds as long as
      the keyword values are the same width.  If the last
      committed revision rolls into a new place value (say, from
      99 to 100), or if another person with a longer username
      commits the file, stuff gets all crooked again.  However, if
      you are using Subversion 1.2 or better, you can use the new
      fixed-length keyword syntax, define some field widths that
      seem sane, and now your file might look like this:</para>

    <screen>
$Rev::               $:  Revision of last commit
$Author::            $:  Author of last commit
$Date::              $:  Date of last commit
</screen>
    
    <para>You commit this change to your file.  This time,
      Subversion notices the new fixed-length keyword syntax, and
      maintains the width of the fields as defined by the padding
      you placed between the double-colon and the trailing dollar
      sign.  After substitution, the width of the fields is
      completely unchanged&mdash;the short values for
      <literal>Rev</literal> and <literal>Author</literal> are
      padded with spaces, and the long <literal>Date</literal>
      field is truncated by a hash character:</para>

    <screen>
$Rev:: 13            $:  Revision of last commit
$Author:: harry      $:  Author of last commit
$Date:: 2006-03-15 0#$:  Date of last commit
</screen>
       
    <para>The use of fixed-length keywords is especially handy
      when performing substitutions into complex file formats that
      themselves use fixed-length fields for data, or for which
      the stored size of a given data field is overbearingly
      difficult to modify from outside the format's native
      application (such as for Microsoft Office documents).</para>

    <warning>
      <para>Be aware that because the width of a keyword field is
        measured in bytes, the potential for corruption of
        multi-byte values exists.  For example, a username which
        contains some multi-byte UTF-8 characters might suffer
        truncation in the middle of the string of bytes which make
        up one of those characters.  The result will be a mere
        truncation when viewed at the byte level, but will likely
        appear as a string with an incorrect or garbled final
        character when viewed as UTF-8 text.  It is conceivable
        that certain applications, when asked to load the file,
        would notice the broken UTF-8 text and deem the entire
        file corrupt, refusing to operate on the file
        altogether.</para>

    <title>Locking</title>

    <para>Subversion's copy-modify-merge version control model lives
      and dies by the granularity of the data merging algorithms
      employed when trying to resolve conflicts caused by multiple
      users modifying the same file concurrently.  Subversion itself
      provides only one such algorithm, a three-way differencing
      algorithm which is smart enough to handle data at a granularity
      of a single line of text.  Subversion also allows you to
      supplement its content merge processing with external
      differencing utilities (as described in <xref
      linkend="svn.advanced.externaldifftools.diff3" />), some of which
      may do an even better job, perhaps providing granularity of a
      word or a single character of text.  But common among those
      algorithms is that they generally work only on text files.  The
      landscape starts to look pretty grim when you start talking
      about content merges of non-textual file formats.  And when you
      can't find a tool that can handle that type of merging, you
      begin to run into problems with the copy-modify-merge
      model.</para>

   <para>Let's look at a real-life example of where this model runs
      aground.  Harry and Sally are both graphic designers working on
      the same project, a bit of marketing collateral for an
      automobile mechanic.  Central to the design of a particular
      poster is an image of a car in need of some body work, stored in
      a file using the PNG image format.  The poster's layout is
      almost finished, and both Harry and Sally are pleased with the
      particular photo they chose for their damaged car&mdash;a baby
      blue 1967 Ford Mustang with an unfortunate bit of crumpling on
      the left front fender.</para>

    <para>Now, as is common in graphic design work, there's a change
      in plans which causes the car's color to be a concern.  So Sally
      updates her working copy to <literal>HEAD</literal>, fires up
      her photo editing software, and sets about tweaking the image so
      that the car is now cherry red.  Meanwhile, Harry, feeling
      particularly inspired that day, decides that the image would
      have greater impact if the car also appears to have suffered
      greater impact.  He, too, updates to <literal>HEAD</literal>,
      and then draws some cracks on the vehicle's windshield.  He
      manages to finish his work before Sally finishes hers, and after
      admiring the fruits of his undeniable talent, commits the
      modified image.  Shortly thereafter, Sally is finished with the
      car's new finish, and tries to commit her changes.  But, as
      expected, Subversion fails the commit, informing Sally that now
      her version of the image is out of date.</para>

    <para>Here's where the difficulty sets in.  Were Harry and Sally
      making changes to a text file, Sally would simply update her
      working copy, receiving Harry's changes in the process.  In the
      worst possible case, they would have modified the same region of
      the file, and Sally would have to work out by hand the proper
      resolution to the conflict.  But these aren't text
      files&mdash;they are binary images.  And while it's a simple
      matter to describe what one would expect the results of this
      content merge to be, there is precious little chance that any
      software exists which is smart enough to examine the common
      baseline image that each of these graphic artists worked
      against, the changes that Harry made, and the changes that Sally
      made, and spit out an image of a busted-up red Mustang with a
      cracked windshield!</para>

    <para>Clearly, things would have gone more smoothly if Harry and
      Sally had serialized their modifications to the image.  If, say,
      Harry had waited to draw his windshield cracks on Sally's
      now-red car, or if Sally had tweaked the color of a car whose
      windshield was already cracked.  As is discussed in <xref
      linkend="svn.basic.vsn-models.copy-merge" />, much of these
      types problems go away entirely where perfect communication
      between Harry and Sally exists.
      <footnote>
        <para>Communication wouldn't have been such bad medicine for
          Harry and Sally's Hollywood namesakes, either, for that
          matter.</para>
      </footnote>
      But as one's version control system is, in fact, one form of
      communication, it follows that having that software facilitate
      the serialization of non-parallelizable energies is no bad
      thing.  And this where Subversion's implementation of the
      lock-modify-unlock model steps into the spotlight.  This is
      where we talk about Subversion's <firstterm>locking</firstterm>
      feature, which is similar to the reserved checkouts mechanisms
      of other version control systems.</para>

    <para>Subversion's locking feature serves two main
      purposes:</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para><emphasis>Serializing access to a versioned
          resource</emphasis>.  But allowing a user to
          programmatically claim the exclusive right to change to a
          file in the repository, that user can be reasonably
          confident that energy invested on unmergeable changes won't
          be wasted; that his commit of those changes will
          succeed.</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para><emphasis>Aiding communication</emphasis>.  By alerting
          other users that serialization is in effect for particular
          versioned resource, those other users can reasonably expect
          that the resource is about to be changed by someone else,
          and they, too, can avoid wasting their time and energy on
          unmergeable changes that won't be committable due to eventual
          out-of-dateness.</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <para>When referring to Subversion's locking feature, one is
      actually talking about a fairly diverse collection of behaviors
      which include the ability to lock a versioned file
      <footnote>
        <para>Subversion does not currently allow locks on directories.</para>
      </footnote>
      (claiming the exclusive right to modify the file), to unlock
      that file (yielding that exclusive right to modify), to see
      reports about which files are locked and by whom, to annotate
      files for which locking before editing is strongly advised, and
      so on.  In this section, we'll cover all of these facets of the
      larger locking feature.</para>

    <sidebar id="svn.advanced.locking.meanings">
      <title>Three meanings of <quote>lock</quote></title>

      <para>In this section, and almost everywhere in this book, the
        words <quote>lock</quote> and <quote>locking</quote> describe
        a mechanism for mutual exclusion between users to avoid
        clashing commits. Unfortunately, there are two other sorts
        of <quote>lock</quote> with which Subversion, and therefore
        this book, sometimes needs to be concerned.</para>

      <para>The first is <firstterm>working copy locks</firstterm>,
        used internally by Subversion to prevent clashes between
        multiple Subversion clients operating on the same working
        copy.  This is the sort of lock indicated by an
        <computeroutput>L</computeroutput> in the third column of
        <command>svn status</command> output, and removed by the
        <command>svn cleanup</command> command, as described in <xref
        linkend="svn.tour.other.cleanup"/>.</para>

      <para>Secondly, there are <firstterm>database locks</firstterm>,
        used internally by the Berkeley DB backend to prevent clashes
        between multiple programs trying to access the database.  This
        is the sort of lock whose unwanted persistence after an error
        can cause a repository to be <quote>wedged</quote>, as
        described in <xref linkend="svn.reposadmin.maint.recovery"/>.</para> 

      <para>You can generally forget about these other sorts of lock,
        until something goes wrong that requires you to care about
        them.  In this book, <quote>lock</quote> means the first sort
        unless the contrary is either clear from context or explicitly
        stated.</para>

    </sidebar>

    <!-- =============================================================== -->
    <sect2 id="svn.advanced.locking.creation">
      <title>Creating locks</title>
      
      <para>In the Subversion repository, a
        <firstterm>lock</firstterm> is a piece of metadata which
        grants exclusive access to one user to change a file.  This
        user is said to be the <firstterm>lock owner</firstterm>.
        Each lock also has a unique identifier, typically a long
        string of characters, known as the <firstterm>lock
        token</firstterm>.  The repository manages locks, ultimately
        handling their creation, enforcement, and removal.  If any
        commit transaction attempts to modify or delete a locked file
        (or delete one of the parent directories of the file), the
        repository will demand two pieces of information&mdash;that
        the client performing the commit be authenticated as the lock
        owner, and that the lock token has been provided as part of
        the commit process as a sort of proof that client knows which
        lock it is using.</para>
      
      <para>To demonstrate lock creation, let's refer back to our
        example of multiple graphic designers working with on the same
        binary image files.  Harry has decided to change a JPEG image.
        To prevent other people from committing changes to the file
        while he is modifying it (as well as alerting them that he is
        about to change it), he locks the file in the repository using
        the <command>svn lock</command> command.</para>

      <screen>
[harry] $ svn lock banana.jpg --message "Editing file for tomorrow's release."
'banana.jpg' locked by user 'harry'.
[harry] $
</screen>

      <para>There are a number of new things demonstrated in the
        previous example.  First, notice that Harry passed the
        <option>--message</option> option to <command>svn
        lock</command>.  Similar to <command>svn commit</command>, the
        <command>svn lock</command> command can take comments (either
        via <option>--message (-m)</option> or <option>--file
        (-F)</option>) to describe the reason for locking the file.
        Unlike <command>svn commit</command>, however, <command>svn
        lock</command> will not demand a message by launching your
        preferred text editor.  Lock comments are optional, but still
        recommended to aid communication.</para>

      <para>Secondly, the lock attempt succeeded.  This means that the
        file wasn't already locked, and that Harry had the latest
        version of the file.  If Harry's working copy of the file had
        been out-of-date, the repository would have rejected the
        request, forcing Harry to <command>svn update</command> and
        reattempt the locking command.  The locking command would also
        have failed if the file already been locked by someone
        else.</para>

      <para>As you can see, the <command>svn lock</command> command
        prints confirmation of the successful lock.  At this point,
        the fact that the file is locked becomes apparent in the
        output of the <command>svn status</command> and <command>svn
        info</command> reporting subcommands.</para>

      <para>That the <command>svn info</command> command, which does
        not contact the repository when run against working copy
        paths, can display the lock token reveals an important fact
        about lock tokens&mdash;that they are cached in the working
        copy.  The presence of the lock token is critical.  It gives
        the working copy authorization to make use of the lock later
        on.  Also, the <command>svn status</command> command shows a
        <literal>K</literal> next to the file (short for locKed),
        indicating that the lock token is present.</para>

      <sidebar>
        <title>Regarding lock tokens</title>

        <para>A lock token isn't an authentication token, so much as
          an <emphasis>authorization</emphasis> token.  The token
          isn't a protected secret.  In fact, a lock's unique token is
          discoverable by anyone who runs <command>svn info
          URL</command>.  A lock token is special only when it lives
          inside a working copy.  It's proof that the lock was created
          in that particular working copy, and not somewhere else by
          some other client.  Merely authenticating as the lock owner
          isn't enough to prevent accidents.</para>

        <para>For example, suppose you lock a file using a computer at
          your office, but leave work for the day before you finish
          your changes to that file.  It should not be possible to
          accidentally commit changes to that same file from your home
          computer later that evening simply because you've
          authenticated as the lock's owner.  In other words, the lock
          token prevents one piece of Subversion-related software from
          undermining the work of another.  (In our example, if you
          really need to change the file from an alternate working
          copy, you would need to break the lock and re-lock the
          file.)</para>

      </sidebar>

      <para>Now that Harry has locked <filename>banana.jpg</filename>,
        Sally is unable to change or delete that file:</para>

      <screen>
[sally] $ svn delete banana.jpg
D         banana.jpg
[sally] $ svn commit -m "Delete useless file."
Deleting       banana.jpg
svn: Commit failed (details follow):

423 Locked (http://svn.example.com)
[sally] $
</screen>

      <para>But Harry, after touching up the banana's shade of yellow,
        is able to commit his changes to the file.  That's because he
        authenticates as the lock owner, and also because his working
        copy holds the correct lock token:</para>

      <screen>
[harry] $ svn status
M    K banana.jpg
[harry] $ svn commit -m "Make banana more yellow"
Sending        banana.jpg
Transmitting file data .
Committed revision 2201.
[harry] $ svn status
[harry] $
</screen>

      <para>Notice that after the commit is finished, <command>svn
        status</command> shows that the lock token is no longer
        present in working copy.  This is the standard behavior of
        <command>svn commit</command>&mdash;it searches the working
        copy (or list of targets, if you provide such a list) for
        local modifications, and sends all the lock tokens it
        encounters during this walk to the server as part of the
        commit transaction.  After the commit completes successfully,
        all of the repository locks that were mentioned are
        released&mdash;<emphasis>even on files that weren't
        committed</emphasis>.  This is meant to discourage users from
        being sloppy about locking, or from holding locks for too
        long.  If Harry haphazardly locks thirty files in a directory
        named <filename>images</filename> because he's unsure of which
        files he needs to change, yet only only changes four of those
        file, when he runs <command>svn commit images</command>, the
        process will still release all thirty locks.</para>

      <para>This behavior of automatically releasing locks can be
        overridden with the <option>--no-unlock</option> option to
        <command>svn commit</command>.  This is best used for those
        times when you want to commit changes, but still plan to make
        more changes and thus need to retain existing locks.  You can
        also make this your default behavior by setting the
        <literal>no-unlock</literal> runtime configuration option (see
        <xref linkend="svn.advanced.confarea" />).</para>

      <para>Of course, locking a file doesn't oblige one to commit a
        change to it.  The lock can be released at any time with a
        simple <command>svn unlock</command> command:</para>

      <screen>
[harry] $ svn unlock banana.c
'banana.c' unlocked.
</screen>

    </sect2>

    <!-- =============================================================== -->
    <sect2 id="svn.advanced.locking.discovery">
      <title>Discovering locks</title>

      <para>When a commit fails due to someone else's locks, it's
        fairly easy to learn about them.  The easiest of
        these is <command>svn status --show-updates</command>:</para>

      <screen>
[sally] $ svn status --show-updates
M              23   bar.c
M    O         32   raisin.jpg
       *       72   foo.h
Status against revision:     105
[sally] $
</screen>

      <para>In this example, Sally can see not only that her copy of
        <filename>foo.h</filename> is out-of-date, but that one of the
        two modified files she plans to commit is locked in the
        repository.  The <literal>O</literal> symbol stands for
        <quote>Other</quote>, meaning that a lock exists on the file,
        and was created by somebody else.  If she were to attempt a
        commit, the lock on <filename>raisin.jpg</filename> would
        prevent it.  Sally is left wondering who made the lock, when,
        and why.  Once again, <command>svn info</command> has the
        answers:</para>

      <para>Just as <command>svn info</command> can be used to examine
        objects in the working copy, it can also be used to examine
        objects in the repository.  If the main argument to
        <command>svn info</command> is a working copy path, then all
        of the working copy's cached information is displayed; any
        mention of a lock means that the working copy is holding a
        lock token (if a file is locked by another user or in another
        working copy, <command>svn info</command> on a working copy
        path will show no lock information at all).  If the main
        argument to <command>svn info</command> is a URL, then the
        information reflects the latest version of an object in the
        repository, and any mention of a lock describes the current
        lock on the object.</para>

      <para>So in this particular example, Sally can see that Harry
        locked the file on February 16th to <quote>make a quick
        tweak</quote>.  It being June, she suspects that he probably
        forgot all about the lock.  She might phone Harry to complain
        and ask him to release the lock.  If he's unavailable, she
        might try to forcibly break the lock herself or ask an
        administrator to do so.</para>

    <sect2 id="svn.advanced.locking.break-steal">
      <title>Breaking and stealing locks</title>

      <para>A repository lock isn't sacred&mdash;in Subversion's
        default configuration state, locks can be released not only by
        the person who created them, but by anyone at all.  When
        somebody other than the original lock creator destroys a lock,

      <para>From the administrator's chair, it's simple to break

      <para>The more interesting option is allowing users to break
        each other's locks over the network.  To do this, one simply
        needs to pass the <option>--force</option> to the unlock
        command:</para>

      <screen>
[sally] $ svn status --show-updates
M              23   bar.c
M    O         32   raisin.jpg
       *       72   foo.h
Status against revision:     105
[sally] $ svn unlock raisin.jpg
svn: 'raisin.jpg' is not locked in this working copy

[sally] $ svn unlock --force http://svn.example.com/repos/project/raisin.jpg
'raisin.jpg' unlocked.
[sally] $
</screen>

      <para>Sally's initial attempt to unlock failed because she
        ran <command>svn unlock</command> directly on her working copy
        of the file, and no lock token was present.  To remove the
        lock directly from the repository, she needs to pass a URL
        to <command>svn unlock</command>.  Her first attempt to unlock
        the URL fails, because she can't authenticate as the lock
        owner (nor does she have the lock token).  But when she
        passes <option>--force</option>, the authentication and
        authorization requirements are ignored, and the remote lock is
        broken.</para>
        
      <para>Of course, simply breaking a lock may not be enough.  In
        the running example, Sally may not only want to break Harry's
        long-forgotten lock, but re-lock the file for her own use.
        She can accomplish this by running <command>svn unlock
        --force</command> and then <command>svn lock</command>
        back-to-back, but there's a small chance that somebody else
        might lock the file between the two commands.  The simpler thing
        to is <firstterm>steal</firstterm> the lock, which involves
        breaking and re-locking the file all in one atomic step.  To
        do this, pass the <option>--force</option> option
        to <command>svn lock</command>:</para>

      <screen>
[sally] $ svn lock raisin.jpg
svn: Lock request failed: 423 Locked (http://svn.example.com)
[sally] $ svn lock --force raisin.jpg
'raisin.jpg' locked by user 'sally'.
[sally] $
</screen>

      <para>In any case, whether the lock is broken or stolen, Harry
        may be in for a surprise.  Harry's working copy still contains
        the original lock token, but that lock no longer exists.  The
        lock token is said to be <firstterm>defunct</firstterm>.  The
        lock represented by the lock-token has either been broken (no
        longer in the repository), or stolen (replaced with a
        different lock).  Either way, Harry can see this by asking
        <command>svn status</command> to contact the
        repository:</para>

      <screen>
[harry] $ svn status
     K raisin.jpg
[harry] $ svn status --show-updates
     B         32   raisin.jpg
[harry] $ svn update
  B  raisin.jpg
[harry] $ svn status
[harry] $
</screen>

      <para>If the repository lock was broken, then <command>svn
        status --show-updates</command> displays a
        <literal>B</literal> (Broken) symbol next to the file.  If a
        new lock exists in place of the old one, then a
        <literal>T</literal> (sTolen) symbol is shown.  Finally,
        <command>svn update</command> notices any defunct lock tokens
        and removes them from the working copy.</para>

      <sidebar>
        <title>Locking Policies</title>
        
        <para>Different systems have different notions of how strict a
          lock should be.  Some folks argue that locks must be
          strictly enforced at all costs, releasable only by the
          original creator or administrator.  They argue that if
          anyone can break a lock, then chaos runs rampant and the
          whole point of locking is defeated.  The other side argues
          that locks are first and foremost a communication tool.  If
          users are constantly breaking each others' locks, then it
          represents a cultural failure within the team and the
          problem falls outside the scope of software enforcement.</para>

        <para>Subversion defaults to the <quote>softer</quote>
          approach, but still allows administrators to create stricter
          enforcement policies through the use of hook scripts.  In
          particular, the <filename>pre-lock</filename> and
          <filename>pre-unlock</filename> hooks allow administrators
          to decide when lock creation and lock releases are allowed
          to happen.  Depending on whether or not a lock already
          exists, these two hooks can decide whether or not to allow a
          certain user to break or steal a lock.  The
          <filename>post-lock</filename> and
          <filename>post-unlock</filename> hooks are also available,
          and can be used to send email after locking actions.  To
          learn more about repository hooks, see <xref
          linkend="svn.reposadmin.create.hooks" />.</para>

      <title>Lock Communication</title>

      <para>We've seen how <command>svn lock</command>
        and <command>svn unlock</command> can be used to create,
        release, break, and steal locks.  This satisfies the goal of
        serializing commit access to a file.  But what about the
        larger problem of preventing wasted time?</para>

      <para>For example, suppose Harry locks an image file and then
        begins editing it.  Meanwhile, miles away, Sally wants to do
        the same thing.  She doesn't think to run <command>svn status
        --show-updates</command>, so she has no idea that Harry has
        already locked the file.  She spends hours editing the file,
        and when she tries to commit her change, she discovers that
        either the file is locked or that she's out-of-date.
        Regardless, her changes aren't mergeable with Harry's.  One of
        these two people has to throw away their work, and a lot of
        time has been wasted.</para>
      
      <para>Subversion's solution to this problem is to provide a
        mechanism to remind users that a file ought to be locked
        <emphasis>before</emphasis> the editing begins.  The mechanism
        is a special property, <literal>svn:needs-lock</literal>.  If
        that property is attached to a file (regardless of its value,
        which is irrelevant), then Subversion will try to use
        filesystem-level permissions to make the file read-only,
        unless, of course, the user has explicitly locked the file.
        When a lock-token is present (as a result of running
        <command>svn lock</command>), the file becomes read-write.
        When the lock is released, the file becomes read-only
        again.</para>

      <para>The theory, then, is that if the image file has this
        property attached, then Sally would immediately notice
        something is strange when she opens the file for editing.
        Many applications alert users immediately when a read-only
        file is opened for editing.  And nearly all applications would
        at least prevert her from saving changes to the file.  This
        reminds her to lock the file before editing, whereby she
        discovers the pre-existing lock:</para>

      <tip>
        <para>Users and administrators alike are encouraged to attach
          the <literal>svn:needs-lock</literal> property to any file
          which cannot be contextually merged.  This is the primary
          technique for encouraging good locking habits and preventing
          wasted effort.</para>
      </tip>

      <para>Note that this property is a communication tool which
        works independently from the locking system.  In other words,
        any file can be locked, whether or not this property is
        present.  And conversely, the presence of this property
        doesn't make the repository require a lock when
        committing.</para>

      <para>Unfortunately, the system isn't flawless.  It's possible
        that even when a file has the property, the read-only reminder
        won't always work.  Sometimes applications misbehave and
        <quote>hijack</quote> the read-only file, silently allowing
        users to edit and save the file anyway.  There's not much that
        Subversion can do in this situation&mdash;at the end of the
        day, there's simply no substitution for good interpersonal
        communication.

    <title>Externals Definitions</title>
    
    <para>Sometimes it is useful to construct a working copy that is
      made out of a number of different checkouts.  For example, you
      may want different subdirectories to come from different
      locations in a repository, or perhaps from different
      repositories altogether.  You could certainly setup such a
      scenario by hand&mdash;using <command>svn checkout</command> to
      create the sort of nested working copy structure you are trying
      to achieve.  But if this layout is important for everyone who
      uses your repository, every other user will need to perform the
      same checkout operations that you did.</para>

    <para>Fortunately, Subversion provides support for
      <firstterm>externals definitions</firstterm>.  An externals
      definition is a mapping of a local directory to the
      URL&mdash;and possibly a particular revision&mdash;of a
      versioned resource.  In Subversion, you declare externals
      definitions in groups using the <literal>svn:externals</literal>
      property.  You can create or modify this property using
      <command>svn propset</command> or <command>svn
      propedit</command> (see <xref linkend="svn.advanced.props.manip"
      />).  It can be set on any versioned directory, and its value is
      a multi-line table of subdirectories (relative to the versioned
      directory on which the property is set) and fully qualified,
      absolute Subversion repository URLs.</para>

    <screen>
$ svn propget svn:externals calc
third-party/sounds             http://sounds.red-bean.com/repos
third-party/skins              http://skins.red-bean.com/repositories/skinproj
third-party/skins/toolkit -r21 http://svn.red-bean.com/repos/skin-maker
</screen>

    <para>The convenience of the <literal>svn:externals</literal>
      property is that once it is set on a versioned directory,
      everyone who checks out a working copy with that directory also
      gets the benefit of the externals definition.  In other words,
      once one person has made the effort to define those nested
      working copy checkouts, no one else has to
      bother&mdash;Subversion will, upon checkout of the original
      working copy, also checkout the external working copies.</para>

    <para>Note the previous externals definition example.  When
      someone checks out a working copy of the
      <filename>calc</filename> directory, Subversion also continues
      to checkout the items found in its externals definition.</para>

    <screen>
$ svn checkout http://svn.example.com/repos/calc

A  calc/Makefile
A  calc/integer.c
A  calc/button.c

A  calc/third-party/sounds/twang.ogg
Checked out revision 14.

&hellip;
</screen>

    <para>If you need to change the externals definition, you can do
      so using the regular property modification subcommands.  When
      you commit a change to the <literal>svn:externals</literal>
      property, Subversion will synchronize the checked-out items
      against the changed externals definition when you next run
      <command>svn update</command>.  The same thing will happen when
      others update their working copies and receive your changes to
      the externals definition.</para>

    <para>The <command>svn status</command> command also recognizes
      externals definitions, displaying a status code of
      <literal>X</literal> for the disjoint subdirectories into which
      externals are checked out, and then recursing into those
      subdirectories to display the status of the external items
      themselves.</para>

    <tip>
      <para>You should strongly consider using explicit revision
        numbers in all of your externals definitions.  Doing so means
        that you get to decide when to pull down a different snapshot
        of external information, and exactly which snapshot to pull.
        Besides the common sense aspect of not being surprised by
        changes to third-party repositories that you might not have
        any control over, using explicit revision numbers also means
        that as you backdate your working copy to a previous
        revision, your externals definitions will also revert to the
        way they looked in that previous revision, which in turn means
        that the external working copies will be updated to match they
        way <emphasis>they</emphasis> looked back when your repository was
        at that previous revision.  For software projects, this could
        be the difference between a successful and a failed build of
        an older snapshot of your complex codebase.</para>
    </tip>

    <para>The support that exists for externals definitions in
      Subversion today can be a little misleading, though.  First, an
      externals definition can only point to directories, not files.
      Second, the externals definition cannot point to relative paths
      (paths like <filename>../../skins/myskin</filename>).  Third, the
      working copies created via the externals definition support are
      still disconnected from the primary working copy (on whose
      versioned directories the <literal>svn:externals</literal>
      property was actually set).  And Subversion still only truly
      operates on non-disjoint working copies.  So, for example, if
      you want to commit changes that you've made in one or more of
      those external working copies, you must run <command>svn
      commit</command> explicitly on those working
      copies&mdash;committing on the primary working copy will not
      recurse into any external ones.</para>

    <para>Also, since the definitions themselves use absolute URLs,
      moving or copying a directory to which they are attached will
      not affect what gets checked out as an external (though the
      relative local target subdirectory will, of course, move with
      renamed directory).  This can be confusing&mdash;even
      frustrating&mdash;in certain situations.  For example, if you
      use externals definitions on a directory in your
      <filename>/trunk</filename> development line which point to
      other areas of that same line, and then you use <command>svn
      copy</command> to branch that line to some new location
      <filename>/branches/my-branch</filename>, the externals
      definitions on items in your new branch will still refer to
      versioned resources in <filename>/trunk</filename>.  Be aware,
      too, that if you need to re-parent your working copy (using
      <command>svn switch --relocate</command>), externals definitions
      will <emphasis>not</emphasis> also be re-parented.</para>

    <para>Finally, there might be times when you would prefer that
      <command>svn</command> subcommands would not recognize or
      otherwise operate on the external working copies created as the
      result of externals definition handling.  In those instances,
      you can pass the <option>--ignore-externals</option> option to
      the subcommand.</para>
