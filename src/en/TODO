This is a -*- text -*- file.


--------------------------------------------------------------

Put in best-practices doc:

  - (perhaps) suggest the use of environment variables to represent
    long repository URLs.  useful for lots of branching/tagging commands.
    Maybe this can go into our existing best-practices doc?


To be fixed by someone:

  - When using shared working copies, a user changing the permissions
    of a file directly (svn ps svn:executable) or indirectly
    (i.e. through an update), must own that file.  There is no way to
    do this automatically which does not involve possible data loss.

  - ch06 talks about Basic authentication and recommends https.
    Add a mention of Digest authentication now that Apache's bug
    has been fixed that broke it and potentially update the 
    example to use it instead.

  - we seem to inconsistently assume repositories live either in
    /usr/local/svn/ or /usr/local/repositories/ throughout the book.
    We ought to consistify to /var/svn.

  - Chapter 8 Section 1.1 "Repository Layer" documents the pre-FSFS state
    of affairs.

  - Appendix D should be reviewed and updated from project_links.html,
    listing only projects that the book authors wish to promote.  A
    generic and full list of related projects can always be found at
    project_links.html -- we hold the power of bias and
    recommendation, and we should wield it.

--------------------------------------------------------------

To be fixed by cmpilato:

   - vendor branch section needs re-working.  again.  specifically,
     note the "replacing 1.0 with 1.1 and 'missing files' stuff (files
     not overwritten by a tarball explode wouldn't be missing, they'd
     be untouched).


--------------------------------------------------------------

To be fixed by sussman:


ch04:

   - need a giant warning-box about issue #2282.  how our lack of
     'true renames' can be really irritating when doing merges.  The
     classic case is when branchA moves things around, and branch B
     just changes file text.  When you merge branchA into branchB, you
     deleting the newer file versions and adding-with-history the
     older file versions.  Definitely a big 'gotcha' to watch out for.


ch06:  

   - explain shortcoming in http checkout authorization.  because
     checkout is done as one http request, there's only one chance to
     authenticate (or not).  if root-dir is anonymously readable, then
     *whole tree* will be checked out anonymously.  if root-dir
     requires authn, then *whole tree* will be checked out as that
     user.  until we get pipelining and do checkouts as multiple GETs,
     it's impossible to change authn halfway through a checkout.


appA:

   - explain why 'svn commit; svn log' won't show the commit.

List of 1.1 features/changes (that still need to be documented)
============================

  * Need whole new section explaining activating l10n (LOCALE=) for
    message translations, and how and IRI autoescaping works.

       This probably needs to be an "advanced topics" chapter 7
       section (MIKE).

List of 1.2 features/changes (that still need to be documented)
============================

  * ch00:  "what's new in svn 1.2".  Ben will do this, like he did for
    the 1.1 book.

  * the new locking feature, and all of its many tendrils.
    touches chapters 2, 3, 5, 9 at a minimum.  (we should all work on this)

  * ch05: comparison of bdb and fsfs:  make it clear that fsfs is now
    the default, need --fs-type bdb to get bdb.  (MIKE)

  * ch06:  client-cred-caching:  mention win32 encryption in
           mod_authz_svn: groups can contain other groups (BEN)

  * Fixed length keywords  (MIKE chapter 7)
    The format of fixed length keyword and its data is
    - Unexpanded keyword:         "$keyword::       $"
    - Expanded keyword:           "$keyword:: value $"
    - Expanded kw with filling:   "$keyword:: value   $"
    - Truncated keyword:          "$keyword:: longval#$"

  * New revprop hook features (ch05 MIKE)
    - Added fifth ACTION argument (A, M, or D)
    - New/old revprop value available on stdin

  * Chapter 5 (MIKE): document the --use-[pre|post]-commit-hook option
     to 'svnadmin load'.

  * Chapter 7 (MIKE): document the --ignore-externals option (added
     'update', 'checkout', 'export', and 'status').  Don't forget the
     reference section.

  * bunches of new command switches, see the CHANGES entry for 1.2.
        (FITZ), chapter 9.

  * Add autoversioning to mod_dav_svn directives in chapter 9 (FITZ).

  * rewrite huge chunks of autoversioning appendix C (BEN)
    Remember to look at r14262, the relevant part of which reads:

       Make autoversioning more friendly, by cooperating with httpd's
       mod_mime.

          - let mod_mime attempt to set 'svn:mime-type' during an
            autoversioning PUT.

          - let mod_mime attempt to set the Content-type: header when
            a non-svn DAV client does a GET (and only when 'svn:mime-type'
            isn't set.)

       In order to make the PUT part work, set 'ModMimeUsePathInfo on'.
       In order to make the GET part work, set 'TypesConfig conf/mime.types'.

  * Need to verify that all reference command line syntaxes in
    <programlisting> tags in chapter 9 are synced with real "svn help"
    output.  This includes:
    
    - Add lock section
    - Add unlock section
    - Update status section
    - Update status output (adding extra cols) EVERYWHERE IN THE WHOLE BOOK
