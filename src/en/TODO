SvnBook issue tracking is migrating to Trac at:
  
  http://svnbook.red-bean.com/trac/

New issues should be filed directly into Trac.
Existing issues will be gradually either fixed, or migrated to Trac.

============================================================================
NEEDED SOMETIME (NOT VERSION-SPECIFIC)
============================================================================

  * Example 8.5 (pool usage) is very odd.  It uses svn_pool_foo() wrappers,
    yet uses apr_status_t, not svn_error_t, error handling.  This is weird.
    Since it is attempting to demonstrate proper Subversion pool coding style,
    it ought to be using SVN_ERR() and svn_error_t everywhere.  Might also
    want to use APR_ARRAY_PUSH().
    
  * Fill in the "### boilerplate" stuff we left for O'Reilly.  No
    reason for the book, printed or otherwise, to not include
    information about feeding bugs back into the svnbook OS community.

  * (perhaps) suggest the use of environment variables to represent
    long repository URLs.  useful for lots of branching/tagging commands.
    Maybe this can go into our existing best-practices doc?

  * When using shared working copies, a user changing the permissions
    of a file directly (svn ps svn:executable) or indirectly
    (i.e. through an update), must own that file.  There is no way to
    do this automatically which does not involve possible data loss.  [BEN]

  * ch06 talks about Basic authentication and recommends https.
    Add a mention of Digest authentication now that Apache's bug
    has been fixed that broke it and potentially update the 
    example to use it instead.  [BEN]

  * we seem to inconsistently assume repositories live either in
    /usr/local/svn/ or /usr/local/repositories/ throughout the book.
    We ought to consistify to /var/svn.  [FITZ]

  * Appendix C should be reviewed and updated from project_links.html,
    listing only projects that the book authors wish to promote.  A
    generic and full list of related projects can always be found at
    project_links.html -- we hold the power of bias and
    recommendation, and we should wield it.  See the section below for
    votes amongst the authors on what to endorse.  [MIKE, BEN, FITZ]

  * vendor branch section needs re-working.  again.  specifically,
    note the "replacing 1.0 with 1.1 and 'missing files' stuff (files
    not overwritten by a tarball explode wouldn't be missing, they'd
    be untouched).  [MIKE]

  * ch04: need a giant warning-box about issue #2282.  how our lack of
    'true renames' can be really irritating when doing merges.  The
    classic case is when branchA moves things around, and branch B
    just changes file text.  When you merge branchA into branchB, you
    deleting the newer file versions and adding-with-history the older
    file versions.  Definitely a big 'gotcha' to watch out for.  [BEN]

  * ch06: explain shortcoming in http checkout authorization.  because
    checkout is done as one http request, there's only one chance to
    authenticate (or not).  if root-dir is anonymously readable, then
    *whole tree* will be checked out anonymously.  if root-dir
    requires authn, then *whole tree* will be checked out as that
    user.  until we get pipelining and do checkouts as multiple GETs,
    it's impossible to change authn halfway through a checkout.  [BEN]

  * appA: explain why 'svn commit; svn log' won't show the commit.  [BEN]

============================================================================
VOTING FOR TOOLS TO BE MENTIONED IN APPENDIX C
============================================================================

In this section, Fitz, Ben and Mike will vote on third-party tools to
be mentioned in Appendix C.  The old "let's just reproduce the
project_links.html file in the book" method was pathetic, lacking in
both effort and utility.  Being weak, we determined to give everyone a
fair shake and list every known integration point and let users
decide.  Next time around, we'll do what we came here to do -- yield
focused, insightful information readers can use and trust.
