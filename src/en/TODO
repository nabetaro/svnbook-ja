NEEDED FOR 1.2 COMPLETION
============================================================================

  * the new locking feature, and all of its many tendrils.
    touches chapters 2, 3, 5, 9 at a minimum.  [MIKE, BEN, FITZ]

  * ch00:  "what's new in svn 1.2".  [BEN]

  * ch05: comparison of bdb and fsfs:  make it clear that fsfs is now
    the default, need --fs-type bdb to get bdb.  [MIKE]

  * ch05:  New revprop hook features  [MIKE]
      - Added fifth ACTION argument (A, M, or D)
      - New/old revprop value available on stdin

  * ch05: document the --use-[pre|post]-commit-hook option to
    'svnadmin load'.  [MIKE]

  * ch06: client-cred-caching: mention win32 encryption in
    mod_authz_svn: groups can contain other groups [BEN]

  * ch07:  Fixed length keywords  [MIKE]
    The format of fixed length keyword and its data is
      - Unexpanded keyword:         "$keyword::       $"
      - Expanded keyword:           "$keyword:: value $"
      - Expanded kw with filling:   "$keyword:: value   $"
      - Truncated keyword:          "$keyword:: longval#$"

  * ch07: document the --ignore-externals option (added 'update',
    'checkout', 'export', and 'status').  Don't forget the reference
    section.  [MIKE]

  * ch09: bunches of new command switches, see the CHANGES entry for
    1.2.  [FITZ]

  * ch09: add autoversioning to mod_dav_svn directives.  [FITZ]

  * appb (the FAQ): Is very pre-FSFS, pre-ra_svn, and pre-history-tracing.

  * Possibly document mod_mime's interaction with Autoversioning: (BEN)

       Make autoversioning more friendly, by cooperating with httpd's
       mod_mime.

          - let mod_mime attempt to set 'svn:mime-type' during an
            autoversioning PUT.

          - let mod_mime attempt to set the Content-type: header when
            a non-svn DAV client does a GET (and only when 'svn:mime-type'
            isn't set.)

       In order to make the PUT part work, set 'ModMimeUsePathInfo on'.
       In order to make the GET part work, set 'TypesConfig conf/mime.types'.

  * Need to verify that all reference command line syntaxes in
    <programlisting> tags in chapter 9 are synced with real "svn help"
    output.  This includes:
    
      - Add lock section
      - Add unlock section
      - Update status section
      - Update status output (adding extra cols) (everywhere in the 
        whole book)

  * Python bindings example (ch8) is very out of date.

============================================================================
NEEDED SOMETIME (NOT VERSION-SPECIFIC)
============================================================================

  * (perhaps) suggest the use of environment variables to represent
    long repository URLs.  useful for lots of branching/tagging commands.
    Maybe this can go into our existing best-practices doc?

  * When using shared working copies, a user changing the permissions
    of a file directly (svn ps svn:executable) or indirectly
    (i.e. through an update), must own that file.  There is no way to
    do this automatically which does not involve possible data loss.  [BEN]

  * ch06 talks about Basic authentication and recommends https.
    Add a mention of Digest authentication now that Apache's bug
    has been fixed that broke it and potentially update the 
    example to use it instead.  [BEN]

  * we seem to inconsistently assume repositories live either in
    /usr/local/svn/ or /usr/local/repositories/ throughout the book.
    We ought to consistify to /var/svn.  [FITZ]

  * Appendix D should be reviewed and updated from project_links.html,
    listing only projects that the book authors wish to promote.  A
    generic and full list of related projects can always be found at
    project_links.html -- we hold the power of bias and
    recommendation, and we should wield it.  [MIKE, BEN, FITZ]

  * vendor branch section needs re-working.  again.  specifically,
    note the "replacing 1.0 with 1.1 and 'missing files' stuff (files
    not overwritten by a tarball explode wouldn't be missing, they'd
    be untouched).  [MIKE]

  * ch04: need a giant warning-box about issue #2282.  how our lack of
    'true renames' can be really irritating when doing merges.  The
    classic case is when branchA moves things around, and branch B
    just changes file text.  When you merge branchA into branchB, you
    deleting the newer file versions and adding-with-history the older
    file versions.  Definitely a big 'gotcha' to watch out for.  [BEN]

  * ch06: explain shortcoming in http checkout authorization.  because
    checkout is done as one http request, there's only one chance to
    authenticate (or not).  if root-dir is anonymously readable, then
    *whole tree* will be checked out anonymously.  if root-dir
    requires authn, then *whole tree* will be checked out as that
    user.  until we get pipelining and do checkouts as multiple GETs,
    it's impossible to change authn halfway through a checkout.  [BEN]

  * appA: explain why 'svn commit; svn log' won't show the commit.  [BEN]
