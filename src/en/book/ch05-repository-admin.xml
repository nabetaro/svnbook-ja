  <title>Repository Administration</title>

  <para>The Subversion repository is the central storehouse of all
    your versioned data.  As such, it becomes an obvious candidate for
    all the love and attention an administrator can offer.  While the
    repository is generally a low-maintenance item, it is important to
    understand how to properly configure and care for it so that
    potential problems are avoided, and actual problems are safely
    resolved.</para>

  <para>In this chapter, we'll discuss how to create and configure a
    Subversion repository.  We'll also talk about repository
    maintenance, providing examples of how and when to use the
    <command>svnlook</command> and <command>svnadmin</command> tools
    provided with Subversion.  We'll address some common questions and
    mistakes, and give some suggestions on how to arrange the data in
    the repository.</para>

  <para>If you plan to access a Subversion repository only in the
    role of a user whose data is under version control (that is, via
    a Subversion client), you can skip this chapter altogether.
    However, if you are, or wish to become, a Subversion repository
    administrator,
    <footnote>
      <para>This may sound really prestigious and lofty, but we're
        just talking about anyone who is interested in that
        mysterious realm beyond the working copy where everyone's
        data hangs out.</para>

    this chapter is for you.</para>

    <title>The Subversion Repository, Defined</title>

    <para>Before jumping into the broader topic of repository
      administration, let's further define what a repository is.  How
      does it look?  How does it feel?  Does it take its tea hot or
      iced, sweetened, and with lemon?  As an administrator, you'll be
      expected to understand the composition of a repository both from
      a literal, OS-level perspective&mdash;how a repository looks and
      acts with respect to non-Subversion tools&mdash;and from a
      logical perspective&mdash;dealing with how data is represented
      <emphasis>inside</emphasis> the repository.</para>

    <para>Seen through the eyes of a typical file browser application
      (such as the Windows Explorer) or command-line based filesystem
      navigation tools, the Subversion repository is just another
      directory full of stuff.  There are some subdirectories with
      human-readable configuration files in them, some subdirectories
      with some not-so-human-readable data files, and so on.  As in
      other areas of the Subversion design, modularity is given high
      regard, and hierarchical organization is preferred to cluttered
      chaos.  So a shallow glance into a typical repository from a
      nuts-and-bolts perspective is sufficient to reveal the basic
      components of the repository:</para>
            
    <screen>
$ ls repos
conf/  dav/  db/  format  hooks/  locks/  README.txt
</screen>

    <para>Here's a quick fly-by overview of what exactly you're seeing
      in this directory listing.  (Don't get bogged down in the
      terminology&mdash;detailed coverage of these components exists
      elsewhere in this and other chapters.)</para>

    <para>Of course, when accessed via the Subversion libraries, this
      otherwise unremarkable collection of files and directories
      suddenly becomes an implementation of a virtual, versioned
      filesystem, complete with customizable event triggers.  This
      filesystem has its own notions of directories and files, very
      similar to the notions of such things held by real filesystems
      (such as NTFS, FAT32, ext3, and so on).  But this is a special
      filesystem&mdash;it hangs these directories and files from
      revisions, keeping all the changes you've ever made to them
      safely stored and forever accessible.  This is where the
      entirety of your versioned data lives.</para>

    <title>Strategies for Repository Deployment</title>

    <para>Due largely to the simplicity of the overall design of the
      Subversion repository and the technologies on which it relies,
      creating and configuring a repository are fairly straightforward
      tasks.  There are a few preliminary decisions you'll want to
      make, but the actual work involved in any given setup of a
      Subversion repository is pretty straightforward, tending towards
      mindless repetition if you find yourself setting up multiples of
      these things.</para>

    <para>Some things you'll want to consider up front, though, are:</para>

    <itemizedlist>

        <para>What data do you expect to live in your repository (or
          repositories), and how will that data be organized?</para>

      <title>Planning Your Repository Organization</title>

      <para>While Subversion allows you to move around versioned files
        and directories without any loss of information, and even
        provides ways of moving whole sets of versioned history from
        one repository to another, doing so can greatly disrupt the
        workflow of those who access the repository often and come to
        expect things to be at certain locations.  So before creating
        a new repository, try to peer into the future a bit; plan
        ahead before placing your data under version control.  By
        conscientiously <quote>laying out</quote> your repository or
        repositories and their versioned contents ahead of time, you
        can prevent many future headaches.</para>

      <para>Let's assume that as repository administrator, you will be
        responsible for supporting the version control system for
        several projects.  Your first decision is whether to use a
        single repository for multiple projects, or to give each
        project its own repository, or some compromise of these
        two.</para>

      <para>There are benefits to using a single repository for
        multiple projects, most obviously the lack of duplicated
        maintenance.  A single repository means that there is one set
        of hook programs, one thing to routinely backup, one thing to
        dump and load if Subversion releases an incompatible new
        version, and so on.  Also, you can move data between projects
        easily, and without losing any historical versioning
        information.</para>

      <para>The downside of using a single repository is that
        different projects may have different requirements in terms of
        the repository event triggers, such as needing to send commit
        notification emails to different mailing lists, or having
        different definitions about what does and does not constitute
        a legitimate commit.  These aren't insurmountable problems, of
        course&mdash;it just means that all of your hook scripts have
        to be sensitive to the layout of your repository rather than
        assuming that the whole repository is associated with a single
        group of people.  Also, remember that Subversion uses
        repository-global revision numbers.  While those numbers don't
        have any particular magical powers, some folks still don't
        like the fact that even though no changes have been made to
        their project lately, the youngest revision number for the
        repository keeps climbing because other projects are actively
        adding new revisions.
        <footnote>
          <para>Whether founded in ignorance or in poorly considered
            concepts about how to derive legitimate software
            development metrics, global revision numbers are a silly
            thing to fear, and <emphasis>not</emphasis> the kind of
            thing you should weigh when deciding how to arrange your
            projects and repositories.</para>
        </footnote>
      </para>

      <para>A middle-ground approach can be taken, too.  For example,
        projects can be grouped by how well they relate to each other.
        You might have a few repositories with a handful of projects
        in each repository.  That way, projects that are likely to
        want to share data can do so easily, and as new revisions are
        added to the repository, at least the developers know that
        those new revisions are at least remotely related to everyone
        who uses that repository.</para>

      <para>After deciding how to organize your projects with respect
        to repositories, you'll probably want to think about directory
        hierarchies within the repositories themselves.  Because
        Subversion uses regular directory copies for branching and
        tagging (see <xref linkend="svn.branchmerge"/>), the
        Subversion community recommends that you choose a repository
        location for each <firstterm>project
        root</firstterm>&mdash;the <quote>top-most</quote> directory
        which contains data related to that project&mdash;and then
        create three subdirectories beneath that root:
        <filename>trunk</filename>, meaning the directory under which
        the main project development occurs;
        <filename>branches</filename>, which is a directory in which
        to create various named branches of the main development line;
        <filename>tags</filename>, which is a collection of tree
        snapshots that are created, and perhaps destroyed, but never
        changed.
        <footnote>
          <para>The <filename>trunk</filename>, <filename>tags</filename>, 
            and <filename>branches</filename> trio are sometimes referred
            to as <quote>the TTB directories</quote>.</para>
        </footnote>
        </para>

      <para>For example, your repository might look like:</para>

      <screen>
/
   calc/
      trunk/
      tags/
      branches/
   calendar/
      trunk/
      tags/
      branches/
   spreadsheet/
      trunk/
      tags/
      branches/
   &hellip;
</screen>

      <para>Note that it doesn't matter where in your repository each
        project root is.  If you have only one project per repository,
        the logical place to put each project root is at the root of
        that project's respective repository.  If you have multiple
        projects, you might want to arrange them in groups inside the
        repository, perhaps putting projects with similar goals or
        shared code in the same subdirectory, or maybe just grouping
        them alphabetically.  Such an arrangement might look
        like:</para>

      <screen>
/
   utils/
      calc/
         trunk/
         tags/
         branches/
      calendar/
         trunk/
         tags/
         branches/
      &hellip;
   office/
      spreadsheet/
         trunk/
         tags/
         branches/
      &hellip;
</screen>

      <para>Lay out your repository in whatever way you see fit.
        Subversion does not expect or enforce a particular layout&mdash;in
        its eyes, a directory is a directory is a directory.
        Ultimately, you should choose the repository arrangement that
        meets the needs of the people who work on the projects that
        live there.</para>

      <para>In the name of full disclosure, though, we'll mention
        another very common layout.  In this layout, the
        <filename>trunk</filename>, <filename>tags</filename>, and
        <filename>branches</filename> directories live in the root
        directory of your repository, and your projects are in
        subdirectories beneath those, like:</para>

      <screen>
/
   trunk/
      calc/
      calendar/
      spreadsheet/
      &hellip;
   tags/
      calc/
      calendar/
      spreadsheet/
      &hellip;
   branches/
      calc/
      calendar/
      spreadsheet/
      &hellip;
</screen>

      <para>There's nothing particularly incorrect about such a
        layout, but it may or may not seem as intuitive for your
        users.  Especially in large, multi-project situations with
        many users, those users may tend to be familiar with only one
        or two of the projects in the repository.  But the
        projects-as-branch-siblings tends to de-emphasize project
        individuality and focus on the entire set of projects as a
        single entity.  That's a social issue though.  We like our
        originally suggested arrangement for purely practical
        reasons&mdash;it's easier to ask about (or modify, or migrate
        elsewhere) the entire history of a single project when there's
        a single repository path that holds the entire
        history&mdash;past, present, tagged, and branched&mdash;for
        that project and that project alone.</para>

      <title>Deciding Where and How to Host Your Repository</title>

      <para>Before creating your Subversion repository, an obvious
        question you'll need to answer is where the thing is going to
        live.  This is strongly connected to a myriad of other
        questions involving how the repository will be accessed (via a
        Subversion server or directly), by whom (users behind your
        corporate firewall or the whole world out on the open
        Internet), what other services you'll be providing around
        Subversion (repository browsing interfaces, e-mail based
        commit notification, etc.), your data backup strategy, and so
        on.</para>

      <para>We cover server choice and configuration in <xref
        linkend="svn.serverconfig" />, but the point we'd like to
        briefly make here is simply that the answers to some of these
        other questions might have implications that force your hand
        when deciding where your repository will live.  For example,
        certain deployment scenarios might require accessing the
        repository via a remote filesystem from multiple computers, in
        which case (as you'll read in the next section) your choice of
        a repository back-end data store turns out not to be a choice
        at all because only one of the available back-ends will work
        in this scenario.</para>

      <para>Addressing each possible way to deploy
        Subversion is both impossible, and outside the scope of this
        book.  We simply encourage you to evaluate your options using
        these pages and other sources as your reference material, and
        plan ahead.</para>

    <sect2 id="svn.reposadmin.basics.backends">
      <title>Choosing a Data Store</title>

      <para>As of version 1.1, Subversion provides two options for the
        type of underlying data store&mdash;often referred to as
        <quote>the back-end</quote> or, somewhat confusingly,
        <quote>the (versioned) filesystem</quote>&mdash;that each
        repository uses.  One type of data store keeps everything in a
        Berkeley DB (or BDB) database environment; repositories that
        use this type are often referred to as being
        <quote>BDB-backed</quote>.  The other type stores data in
        ordinary flat files, using a custom format.  Subversion

      <para>There are advantages and disadvantages to each of these
        two back-end types.  Neither of them is more
        <quote>official</quote> than the other, though the newer FSFS
        is the default data store as of Subversion 1.2.  Both are
        reliable enough to trust with your versioned data.  But as you
        can see in <xref
        linkend="svn.reposadmin.basics.backends.tbl-1" />, the FSFS
        backend provides quite a bit more flexibility in terms of its
        supported deployment scenarios.  More flexibility means you
        have to work a little harder to find ways to deploy it
        incorrectly.  Those reasons&mdash;plus the fact that not using
        Berkeley DB means there's one fewer component in the
        system&mdash;largely explain why today almost everyone uses
        the FSFS backend when creating new repositories.</para>

      <para>Fortunately, most programs which access Subversion
        repositories are blissfully ignorant of which back-end data
        store is in use.  And you aren't even necessarily stuck with
        your first choice of a data store&mdash;in the event that you
        change your mind later, Subversion provides ways of migrating
        your repository's data into another repository that uses a
        different back-end data store.  We talk more about that later
        in this chapter.</para>

      <note>
        <para>Beginning in Subversion 1.5, repositories of both
          back-end types also use SQLite databases to maintain
          redundant indexes of certain bits of repository data.  This
          is done to improve Subversion's performance.  The Subversion
          tool chain doesn't expose&mdash;and really has no reason to
          expose&mdash;this detail, so we suspect that Subversion
          repository administrators shouldn't need to pay much
          attention to it detail, either.  As such, we don't
          currently have any practical administration tips for this 
          bit of Subversion.</para>
      </note>

      <para>The following subsections provide a more detailed look at
        the available back-end data store types.</para>

      <sect3 id="svn.reposadmin.basics.backends.bdb">
        <title>Berkeley DB</title>
        
        <para>When the initial design phase of Subversion was in
          progress, the developers decided to use Berkeley DB for a
          variety of reasons, including its open-source license,
          transaction support, reliability, performance, API
          simplicity, thread-safety, support for cursors, and so
          on.</para>

        <para>Berkeley DB provides real transaction
          support&mdash;perhaps its most powerful feature.  Multiple
          processes accessing your Subversion repositories don't have
          to worry about accidentally clobbering each other's data.
          The isolation provided by the transaction system is such
          that for any given operation, the Subversion repository code
          sees a static view of the database&mdash;not a database that
          is constantly changing at the hand of some other
          process&mdash;and can make decisions based on that view.  If
          the decision made happens to conflict with what another
          process is doing, the entire operation is rolled back as if
          it never happened, and Subversion gracefully retries the
          operation against a new, updated (and yet still static) view
          of the database.</para>

        <para>Another great feature of Berkeley DB is <firstterm>hot
          backups</firstterm>&mdash;the ability to backup the database
          environment without taking it <quote>offline</quote>.  We'll
          discuss how to backup your repository in <xref
          linkend="svn.reposadmin.maint.backup"/>, but the benefits of being
          able to make fully functional copies of your repositories
          without any downtime should be obvious.</para>

        <para>Berkeley DB is also a very reliable database system when
          properly used.  Subversion uses Berkeley DB's logging
          facilities, which means that the database first writes to
          on-disk log files a description of any modifications it is
          about to make, and then makes the modification itself.  This
          is to ensure that if anything goes wrong, the database
          system can back up to a previous
          <firstterm>checkpoint</firstterm>&mdash;a location in the
          log files known not to be corrupt&mdash;and replay
          transactions until the data is restored to a usable state.
          See <xref linkend="svn.reposadmin.maint.diskspace"/> for
          more about Berkeley DB log files.</para>

        <para>But every rose has its thorn, and so we must note some
          known limitations of Berkeley DB.  First, Berkeley DB
          environments are not portable.  You cannot simply copy a
          Subversion repository that was created on a Unix system onto
          a Windows system and expect it to work.  While much of the
          Berkeley DB database format is architecture independent,
          there are other aspects of the environment that are not.
          Secondly, Subversion uses Berkeley DB in a way that will not
          operate on Windows 95/98 systems&mdash;if you need to house
          a BDB-backed repository on a Windows machine, stick with
          Windows 2000 or newer.</para>

        <para>While Berkeley DB promises to behave correctly on
          network shares that meet a particular set of specifications,
          <footnote>
            <para>Berkeley DB requires that the underlying filesystem
              implement strict POSIX locking semantics, and more
              importantly, the ability to map files directly into
              process memory.</para>
          </footnote>
          most networked filesystem types and appliances do
          <emphasis>not</emphasis> actually meet those requirements.
          And in no case can you allow a BDB-backed repository that
          resides on a network share to be accessed by multiple
          clients of that share at once (which quite often is the
          whole point of having the repository live on a network share
          in the first place).</para>

        <warning>
          <para>If you attempt to use Berkeley DB on a non-compliant
            remote filesystem, the results are unpredictable&mdash;you
            may see mysterious errors right away, or it may be months
            before you discover that your repository database is
            subtly corrupted.  You should strongly consider using the
            FSFS data store for repositories that need to live on a
            network share.</para>
        </warning>
          
        <para>Finally, because Berkeley DB is a library linked
          directly into Subversion, it's more sensitive to
          interruptions than a typical relational database system.
          Most SQL systems, for example, have a dedicated server
          process that mediates all access to tables.  If a program
          accessing the database crashes for some reason, the database
          daemon notices the lost connection and cleans up any mess
          left behind.  And because the database daemon is the only
          process accessing the tables, applications don't need to
          worry about permission conflicts.  These things are not the
          case with Berkeley DB, however.  Subversion (and programs
          using Subversion libraries) access the database tables
          directly, which means that a program crash can leave the
          database in a temporarily inconsistent, inaccessible state.
          When this happens, an administrator needs to ask Berkeley DB
          to restore to a checkpoint, which is a bit of an annoyance.
          Other things can cause a repository to <quote>wedge</quote>
          besides crashed processes, such as programs conflicting over
          ownership and permissions on the database files.</para>

        <note>
          <para>Berkeley DB 4.4 brings (to Subversion 1.4 and better)
            the ability for Subversion to automatically and
            transparently recover Berkeley DB environments in need of
            such recovery.  When a Subversion process attaches to a
            repository's Berkeley DB environment, it uses some process
            accounting mechanisms to detect any unclean disconnections
            by previous processes, performs any necessary recovery,
            and then continues on as if nothing happened.  This
            doesn't completely eliminate instances of repository
            wedging, but it does drastically reduce the amount of
            human interaction required to recover from them.</para>
        </note>

        <para>So while a Berkeley DB repository is quite fast and
          scalable, it's best used by a single server process running
          as one user&mdash;such as Apache's <command>httpd</command>
          or <command>svnserve</command> (see <xref
          linkend="svn.serverconfig"/>)&mdash;rather than accessing it
          as many different users via <literal>file://</literal> or
          <literal>svn+ssh://</literal> URLs.  If accessing a Berkeley DB
          repository directly as multiple users, be sure to read <xref
          linkend="svn.serverconfig.multimethod"/>.</para>

      <sect3 id="svn.reposadmin.basics.backends.fsfs">
        <title>FSFS</title>

        <para>In mid-2004, a second type of repository storage
          system&mdash;one which doesn't use a database at
          all&mdash;came into being.  An FSFS repository stores the
          changes associated with a revision in a single file, and so
          all of a repository's revisions can be found in a single
          subdirectory full of numbered files.  Transactions are
          created in separate subdirectories as individual files.
          When complete, the transaction file is renamed and moved
          into the revisions directory, thus guaranteeing that commits
          are atomic.  And because a revision file is permanent and
          unchanging, the repository also can be backed up while
          <quote>hot</quote>, just like a BDB-backed
          repository.</para>

        <para>The FSFS revision files describe a revision's
          directory structure, file contents, and deltas against files
          in other revision trees.  Unlike a Berkeley DB database,
          this storage format is portable across different operating
          systems and isn't sensitive to CPU architecture.  Because
          there's no journaling or shared-memory files being used, the
          repository can be safely accessed over a network filesystem
          and examined in a read-only environment.  The lack of
          database overhead also means that the overall repository
          size is a bit smaller.</para>

        <para>FSFS has different performance characteristics too.
          When committing a directory with a huge number of files,
          FSFS is able to more quickly append directory entries.  On
          the other hand, FSFS writes the latest version of a file as
          a delta against an earlier version, which means that
          checking out the latest tree is a bit slower than fetching
          the fulltexts stored in a Berkeley DB HEAD revision.  FSFS
          also has a longer delay when finalizing a commit, which
          could in extreme cases cause clients to time out while
          waiting for a response.</para>

        <para>The most important distinction, however, is FSFS's
          imperviousness to <quote>wedging</quote> when something goes
          wrong.  If a process using a Berkeley DB database runs into
          a permissions problem or suddenly crashes, the database can
          be left in an unusable state until an administrator recovers
          it.  If the same scenarios happen to a process using an FSFS
          repository, the repository isn't affected at all.  At worst,
          some transaction data is left behind.</para>

        <para>The only real argument against FSFS is its relative
          immaturity compared to Berkeley DB.  Unlike Berkeley DB,
          which has years of history, its own dedicated development
          team and, now, Oracle's mighty name attached to it,
          <footnote>
            <para>Oracle bought Sleepycat and its flagship software,
              Berkeley DB, on Valentine's Day in 2006.</para>
          </footnote>
          FSFS is a much newer bit of engineering.  Prior to
          Subversion 1.4, it was still shaking out some pretty serious
          data integrity bugs which, while only triggered in very rare
          cases, nonetheless did occur.  That said, FSFS has quickly
          become the back-end of choice for some of the largest public
          and private Subversion repositories, and promises a lower
          barrier to entry for Subversion across the board.</para>

      <para>Subversion repository creation is an incredibly simple

      <title>Implementing Repository Hooks</title>

      <para>A <firstterm>hook</firstterm> is a program triggered by
        some repository event, such as the creation of a new revision
        or the modification of an unversioned property.  Some hooks
        (the so-called <quote>pre hooks</quote>) run in advance of a
        repository operation and provide a means by which to both
        report what is about to happen and to prevent it from
        happening at all.  Other hooks (the <quote>post hooks</quote>)
        run after the completion of a repository event, and are useful
        for performing tasks that examine&mdash;but don't
        modify&mdash;the repository.  Each hook is handed enough
        information to tell what that event is (or was), the specific
        repository changes proposed (or completed), and the username
        of the person who triggered the event.</para>
            
      <para>The <filename>hooks</filename> subdirectory is, by
        default, filled with templates for various repository
        hooks.</para>
            
      <screen>
$ ls repos/hooks/
post-commit.tmpl	  post-unlock.tmpl  pre-revprop-change.tmpl
post-lock.tmpl		  pre-commit.tmpl   pre-unlock.tmpl
post-revprop-change.tmpl  pre-lock.tmpl     start-commit.tmpl
</screen>
            
      <para>There is one template for each hook that the Subversion
        repository supports, and by examining the contents of those
        template scripts, you can see what triggers each script
        to run and what data is passed to that script.  Also present
        in many of these templates are examples of how one might use
        that script, in conjunction with other Subversion-supplied
        programs, to perform common useful tasks.  To actually install
        a working hook, you need only place some executable program or
        script into the <filename>repos/hooks</filename> directory
        which can be executed as the name (like
        <command>start-commit</command> or
        <command>post-commit</command>) of the hook.</para>

      <para>On Unix platforms, this means supplying a script or
        program (which could be a shell script, a Python program, a
        compiled C binary, or any number of other things) named
        exactly like the name of the hook.  Of course, the template
        files are present for more than just informational
        purposes&mdash;the easiest way to install a hook on Unix
        platforms is to simply copy the appropriate template file to a
        new file that lacks the <literal>.tmpl</literal> extension,
        customize the hook's contents, and ensure that the script is
        executable.  Windows, however, uses file extensions to
        determine whether or not a program is executable, so you would
        need to supply a program whose basename is the name of the
        hook, and whose extension is one of the special extensions
        recognized by Windows for executable programs, such as
        <filename>.exe</filename> for programs, and
        <filename>.bat</filename> for batch files.</para>

      <tip>
        <para>For security reasons, the Subversion repository executes
          hook programs with an empty environment&mdash;that is, no
          environment variables are set at all, not even
          <literal>$PATH</literal> (or <literal>%PATH%</literal>,
          under Windows).  Because of this, many administrators
          are baffled when their hook program runs fine by hand, but
          doesn't work when run by Subversion.  Be sure to explicitly
          set any necessary environment variables in your hook program
          and/or use absolute paths to programs.</para>
      </tip>

      <para>Subversion executes hooks as the same user who owns the
        process which is accessing the Subversion repository.  In most
        cases, the repository is being accessed via a Subversion
        server, so this user is the same user as which that server
        runs on the system.  The hooks themselves will need to be
        configured with OS-level permissions that allow that user to
        execute them.  Also, this means that any file or programs
        (including the Subversion repository itself) accessed directly
        or indirectly by the hook will be accessed as the same user.
        In other words, be alert to potential permission-related
        problems that could prevent the hook from performing the tasks
        it is designed to perform.</para>

      <para>There are nine hooks implemented by the Subversion
        repository, and you can get details about each of them in
        <xref linkend="svn.ref.reposhooks" />.  As a repository
        administrator, you'll need to decide which of hooks you wish
        to implement (by way of providing an appropriately named and
        permissioned hook program), and how.  When you make this
        decision, keep in mind
        the big picture of how your repository is deployed.
        For example, if you are using server configuration
        to determine which users are permitted to commit
        changes to your repository, then you don't need to do this
        sort of access control via the hook system.</para>

      <para>There is no shortage of Subversion hook programs and
        scripts freely available either from the Subversion community
        itself or elsewhere.  These scripts cover a wide range of
        utility&mdash;basic access control, policy adherence checking,
        issue tracker integration, email- or syndication-based commit
        notification, and beyond.  See <xref linkend="svn.3rdparty" />
        for discussion of some of the most commonly used hook
        programs.  Or, if you wish to write your own, see <xref
        linkend="svn.developer" />.</para>

      <warning>
        <para>While hook scripts can do almost
          anything, there is one dimension in which hook script
          authors should show restraint:  do <emphasis>not</emphasis>
          modify a commit transaction using hook scripts.  While it
          might be tempting to use hook scripts to automatically
          correct errors or shortcomings or policy violations present
          in the files being committed, doing so can cause problems.
          Subversion keeps client-side caches of certain bits of
          repository data, and if you change a commit transaction in
          this way, those caches become indetectably stale.  This
          inconsistency can lead to surprising and unexpected
          behavior.  Instead of modifying the transaction, you should
          simply <emphasis>validate</emphasis> the transaction in the
          <filename>pre-commit</filename> hook and reject the commit
          if it does not meet the desired requirements.  As a
          bonus, your users will learn the value of careful,
          compliance-minded work habits.</para>

      <title>Berkeley DB Configuration</title>

      <para>A Berkeley DB environment is an encapsulation of one or
        more databases, log files, region files and configuration
        files.  The Berkeley DB environment has its own set of default
        configuration values for things like the number of database locks
        allowed to be taken out at any given time, or the maximum size
        of the journaling log files, etc.  Subversion's filesystem
        logic additionally chooses default values for some of the
        Berkeley DB configuration options.  However, sometimes your
        particular repository, with its unique collection of data and
        access patterns, might require a different set of
        configuration option values.</para>

      <para>The producers of Berkeley DB understand that different
        applications and database environments have different
        requirements, and so they have provided a mechanism for
        overriding at runtime many of the configuration values for the
        Berkeley DB environment:  BDB checks for the presence of
        a file named <filename>DB_CONFIG</filename> in the environment
        directory (namely, the repository's
        <filename>db</filename> subdirectory), and parses the options found in that file .  Subversion itself creates
        this file when it creates the rest of the repository.  The
        file initially contains some default options, as well as
        pointers to the Berkeley DB online documentation so you can
        read about what those options do.  Of course, you are free to
        add any of the supported Berkeley DB options to your
        <filename>DB_CONFIG</filename> file.  Just be aware that while
        Subversion never attempts to read or interpret the contents of
        the file, and makes no direct use of the option settings in
        it, you'll want to avoid any configuration changes that may
        cause Berkeley DB to behave in a fashion that is at odds with
        what Subversion might expect.  Also, changes made to
        <filename>DB_CONFIG</filename> won't take effect until you
        recover the database environment (using <command>svnadmin
        recover</command>).</para>

    <title>Repository Maintenance</title>

    <para>Maintaining a Subversion repository can be daunting,

      tools&mdash;what they are, when to use them, and how to use
      them.  This section will introduce you to the repository

        <para><command>svnlook</command> is a tool provided by
          Subversion for examining the various revisions and
          <firstterm>transactions</firstterm> (which are revisions
          in-the-making) in a repository.  No part of this program
          attempts to change the repository.  <command>svnlook</command>
          is typically used by the repository hooks for reporting the
          changes that are about to be committed (in the case of the
          <command>pre-commit</command> hook) or that were just
          committed (in the case of the <command>post-commit</command>
          hook) to the repository.  A repository administrator may use
          this tool for diagnostic purposes.</para>
            
        <para><command>svnlook</command> has a straightforward
          syntax:</para>
            
        <screen>
$ svnlook help
general usage: svnlook SUBCOMMAND REPOS_PATH [ARGS &amp; OPTIONS ...]
Note: any subcommand which takes the '--revision' and '--transaction'
      options will, if invoked without one of those options, act on
      the repository's youngest revision.
Type 'svnlook help &lt;subcommand&gt;' for help on a specific subcommand.
Type 'svnlook --version' to see the program version and FS modules.
&hellip;
</screen>

        <para>Nearly every one of <command>svnlook</command>'s
          subcommands can operate on either a revision or a
          transaction tree, printing information about the tree
          itself, or how it differs from the previous revision of the
          repository.  You use the <option>--revision (-r)</option> and
          <option>--transaction (-t)</option> options to specify which
          revision or transaction, respectively, to examine.  In the
          absence of both the <option>--revision (-r)</option> and
          <option>--transaction (-t)</option> options,
          <command>svnlook</command> will examine the youngest (or
          <quote>HEAD</quote>) revision in the repository.  So the
          following two commands do exactly the same thing when 19 is
          the youngest revision in the repository located at
          <filename>/var/svn/repos</filename>:</para>

        <screen>
$ svnlook info /var/svn/repos
$ svnlook info /var/svn/repos -r 19

        <para>The only exception to these rules about subcommands is
          the <command>svnlook youngest</command> subcommand, which
          takes no options, and simply prints out the repository's
          youngest revision number.</para>

        <screen>
$ svnlook youngest /var/svn/repos

</screen>

        <note>
          <para>Keep in mind that the only transactions you can browse
            are uncommitted ones.  Most repositories will have no such
            transactions, because transactions are usually either
            committed (in which case, you should access them as
            revision with the <option>--revision (-r)</option> option) or
            aborted and removed.</para>

        <para>Output from <command>svnlook</command> is designed to be

        <para>The output of the <literal>info</literal> subcommand is

        <para>This output is human-readable, meaning items like the
          datestamp are displayed using a textual representation
          instead of something more obscure (such as the number of
          nanoseconds since the Tasty Freeze guy drove by).  But the
          output is also machine-parsable&mdash;because the log
          message can contain multiple lines and be unbounded in
          length, <command>svnlook</command> provides the length of
          that message before the message itself.  This allows scripts
          and other wrappers around this command to make intelligent
          decisions about the log message, such as how much memory to
          allocate for the message, or at least how many bytes to skip
          in the event that this output is not the last bit of data in
          the stream.</para>

        <para><command>svnlook</command> can perform a variety of
          other queries:  displaying subsets of bits of information

        <para>While not an official member of the Subversion
          toolchain, the <command>fsfs-reshard.py</command> script
          (found in the <filename>tools/server-side</filename>
          directory of the Subversion source distribution) is a useful
          performance tuning tool for administrators of FSFS-backed
          Subversion repositories.  FSFS repositories contain files
          which describe the changes made in a single revision, and
          files which contain the revision properties associated with
          a single revision.  Repositories created in versions of
          Subversion prior to 1.5 keep these files in two
          directories&mdash;one for each type of file.  As new
          revisions are committed to the repository, Subversion drops
          more files into these two directories, and over time, the
          number of these files in each directory can grow to be quite
          large.  This has been observed to cause perfomance problems
          on certain network-based filesystems.</para>

        <para>Subversion 1.5 creates FSFS-backed repositories using a
          slightly modified layout in which the contents of these two
          directories are <firstterm>sharded</firstterm>, or scattered
          across several subdirectories.  This can greatly reduce the
          time it takes the system to locate any one of these files,
          and therefore increases the overall performance of
          Subversion when reading from the repository.  The number of
          subdirectories used to house these files is configurable,
          though, and that's where
          <filename>fsfs-reshard.py</filename> comes in.  This script
          reshuffles the repository's file structure into a new
          arrangement which reflects the requested number of sharding
          subdirecties.  This is especially useful for converting an
          older Subversion repository into the new Subversion 1.5
          sharded layout (which Subversion will not automatically do
          for you), or for fine-tuning an already-sharded
          repository.</para>

        <title>Berkeley DB Utilities</title>

        <para>If you're using a Berkeley DB repository, then all of
          your versioned filesystem's structure and data live in a set
          of database tables within the <filename>db/</filename>
          subdirectory of your repository.  This subdirectory is a
          regular Berkeley DB environment directory, and can therefore
          be used in conjunction with any of the Berkeley database
          tools, typically provided as part of the Berkeley DB
          distribution.</para>

        <para>For day-to-day Subversion use, these tools are
          unnecessary.  Most of the functionality typically needed for
          Subversion repositories has been duplicated in the
          <command>svnadmin</command> tool.  For example,
          <command>svnadmin list-unused-dblogs</command> and
          <command>svnadmin list-dblogs</command> perform a
          subset of what is provided by the Berkeley
          <command>db_archive</command> command, and <command>svnadmin
          recover</command> reflects the common use cases of the
          <command>db_recover</command> utility.</para>
            
        <para>However, there are still a few Berkeley DB utilities
          that you might find useful.  The <command>db_dump</command>
          and <command>db_load</command> programs write and read,
          respectively, a custom file format which describes the keys
          and values in a Berkeley DB database.  Since Berkeley
          databases are not portable across machine architectures,
          this format is a useful way to transfer those databases from
          machine to machine, irrespective of architecture or
          operating system.  As we describe later in this chapter, you
          can also use <command>svnadmin dump</command> and
          <command>svnadmin load</command> for similar purposes, but
          <command>db_dump</command> and <command>db_load</command>
          can do certain jobs just as well and much faster.  They can
          also be useful if the experienced Berkeley DB hacker needs
          to do in-place tweaking of the data in a BDB-backed
          repository for some reason, which is something Subversion's
          utilities won't allow.  Also, the <command>db_stat</command>
          utility can provide useful information about the status of
          your Berkeley DB environment, including detailed statistics
          about the locking and storage subsystems.</para>

      <para>While the cost of storage has dropped incredibly in the

        administrators seeking to version large amounts of data.
        Every bit of version history information stored in the live
        repository needs to be backed up
        elsewhere, perhaps multiple times as part of rotating backup
        schedules.  It is useful to know what pieces of Subversion's

      <sect3 id="svn.reposadmin.maint.diskspace.deltas">
        <title>How Subversion saves disk space</title>

        <para>To keep the repository small,
          Subversion uses <firstterm>deltification</firstterm> (or,
          <quote>deltified storage</quote>) within the repository
          itself.  Deltification involves encoding the representation
          of a chunk of data as a collection of differences against
          some other chunk of data.  If the two pieces of data are
          very similar, this deltification results in storage savings
          for the deltified chunk&mdash;rather than taking up space
          equal to the size of the original data, it takes up only
          enough space to say, <quote>I look just like this other
          piece of data over here, except for the following couple of
          changes</quote>.  The result is that most of the repository
          data that tends to be bulky&mdash;namely, the contents of
          versioned files&mdash;is stored at a much smaller size than
          the original <quote>fulltext</quote> representation of that
          data.  And for repositories created with Subversion 1.4 or
          later, the space savings are even better&mdash;now those
          fulltext representations of file contents are themselves
          compressed.</para>

        <note>
          <para>Because all of the data that is subject to
            deltification in a BDB-backed repository is stored in a
            single Berkeley DB database file, reducing the size of the
            stored values will not immediately reduce the size of the
            database file itself.  Berkeley DB will, however, keep
            internal records of unused areas of the database file, and
            consume those areas first before growing the size of the
            database file.  So while deltification doesn't produce
            immediate space savings, it can drastically slow future
            growth of the database.</para>

          Regardless of the reason, dead transactions can happen.

        <title>Purging unused Berkeley DB logfiles</title>

        <para>Until recently, the largest offender of disk space usage
          with respect to BDB-backed Subversion repositories was the
          log files in which Berkeley DB performs its pre-writes
          before modifying the actual database files.  These files
          capture all the actions taken along the route of changing
          the database from one state to another&mdash;while the
          database files, at any given time, reflect a particular state, the log
          files contain all the many changes along the way <emphasis>between</emphasis>
          states.  Thus, they can grow and accumulate quite
          rapidly.</para>

        <para>Fortunately, beginning with the 4.2 release of Berkeley
          DB, the database environment has the ability to remove its
          own unused log files automatically.  Any
          repositories created using an <command>svnadmin</command>
          which is compiled against Berkeley DB version 4.2 or greater
          will be configured for this automatic log file removal.  If
          you don't want this feature enabled, simply pass the
          <option>--bdb-log-keep</option> option to the
          <command>svnadmin create</command> command.  If you forget
          to do this, or change your mind at a later time, simply edit
          the <filename>DB_CONFIG</filename> file found in your
          repository's <filename>db</filename> directory, comment out
          the line which contains the <literal>set_flags
          DB_LOG_AUTOREMOVE</literal> directive, and then run
          <command>svnadmin recover</command> on your repository to
          force the configuration changes to take effect.  See <xref
          linkend="svn.reposadmin.create.bdb"/> for more information about
          database configuration.</para>

        <para>Without some sort of automatic log file removal in
          place, log files will accumulate as you use your repository.
          This is actually somewhat of a feature of the database
          system&mdash;you should be able to recreate your entire
          database using nothing but the log files, so these files can
          be useful for catastrophic database recovery.  But
          typically, you'll want to archive the log files that are no
          longer in use by Berkeley DB, and then remove them from disk
          to conserve space.  Use the <command>svnadmin
          list-unused-dblogs</command> command to list the unused
          log files:</para>

      <title>Berkeley DB Recovery</title>

      <para>As mentioned in <xref
        linkend="svn.reposadmin.basics.backends.bdb"/>, a Berkeley DB
        repository can sometimes be left in frozen state if not closed
        properly.  When this happens, an administrator needs to rewind
        the database back into a consistent state.  This is unique to
        BDB-backed repositories, though&mdash;if you are using
        FSFS-backed ones instead, this won't apply to you.  And for
        those of you using Subversion 1.4 with Berkeley DB 4.4 or
        better, you should find that Subversion has become much more
        resilient in these types of situations.  Still, wedged
        Berkeley DB repositories do occur, and an administrator needs
        to know how to safely deal with this circumstance.</para>

      <para>In order to protect the data in your repository, Berkeley
        DB uses a locking mechanism.  This mechanism ensures that
        portions of the database are not simultaneously modified by
        multiple database accessors, and that each process sees the
        data in the correct state when that data is being read from
        the database.  When a process needs to change something in the
        database, it first checks for the existence of a lock on the
        target data.  If the data is not locked, the process locks the
        data, makes the change it wants to make, and then unlocks the
        data.  Other processes are forced to wait until that lock is
        removed before they are permitted to continue accessing that
        section of the database.  (This has nothing to do with the
        locks that you, as a user, can apply to versioned files within
        the repository; we try to clear up the confusion caused by
        this terminology collision in <xref
        linkend="svn.advanced.locking.meanings" />.)</para>

      <para>In the course of using your Subversion repository, fatal
        errors or interruptions can prevent a process from having the
        chance to remove the locks it has placed in the database.  The
        result is that the back-end database system gets
        <quote>wedged</quote>.  When this happens, any attempts to
        access the repository hang indefinitely (since each new
        accessor is waiting for a lock to go away&mdash;which isn't
        going to happen).</para>

      <para>If this happens to your repository, don't panic.  The
        Berkeley DB filesystem takes advantage of database
        transactions and checkpoints and pre-write journaling to
        ensure that only the most catastrophic of events
        <footnote>
          <para>E.g.:  hard drive + huge electromagnet = disaster.</para>
        </footnote>
        can permanently destroy a database environment.  A
        sufficiently paranoid repository administrator will have made
        off-site backups of the repository data in some fashion, but
        don't head off to the tape backup storage closet just yet.</para>

      <para>Instead, use the following recipe to attempt to
        <quote>unwedge</quote> your repository:</para>
   
      <orderedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>Make sure that there are no processes accessing (or

          <para>Become the user who owns and manages the repository.
            This is important, as recovering a repository while

      <para>This procedure fixes almost every case of repository
        lock-up.  Make sure that you run this command as the user that
        owns and manages the database, not just as
        <literal>root</literal>.  Part of the recovery process might
        involve recreating from scratch various database files (shared
        memory regions, for example).  Recovering as

        are owned by <literal>root</literal>, which means that even
        after you restore connectivity to your repository, regular

      <para>If the previous procedure, for some reason, does not

        things.  First, move your broken repository directory aside
        (perhaps by renaming it to something like
        <filename>repos.BROKEN</filename>) and then restore your
        latest backup of it.  Then, send an email to the Subversion
        user list (at <email>users@subversion.tigris.org</email>)
        describing your problem in detail.  Data integrity is an
        extremely high priority to the Subversion developers.</para>

      <title>Migrating Repository Data Elsewhere</title>
    
      <para>A Subversion filesystem has its data spread throughout
        files in the repository, in a fashion generally
        understood by (and of interest to) only the Subversion
        developers themselves.  However, circumstances may arise that
        call for all, or some subset, of that data to be copied or
        moved into another repository.</para>

      <para>Subversion provides such functionality by way of
        repository dump streams.  A repository dump stream (often
        referred to as a <quote>dumpfile</quote> when stored as a file
        on disk) is a portable, flat file format that describes the
        various revisions in your repository&mdash;what was changed,
        by whom, when, and so on.  This dump stream is the primary
        mechanism used to marshal versioned history&mdash;in whole or
        in part, with or without modification&mdash;between
        repositories.  And Subversion provides the tools necessary for
        creating and loading these dump streams&mdash;the
        <command>svnadmin dump</command> and <command>svnadmin
        load</command> subcommands, respectively.</para>

      <warning>
        <para>While the Subversion repository dump format contains
          human-readable portions and a familiar structure (it
          resembles an RFC-822 format, the same type of format used
          for most email), it is <emphasis>not</emphasis> a plaintext
          file format.  It is a binary file format, highly sensitive
          to meddling.  For example, many text editors will corrupt
          the file by automatically converting line endings.</para>
      </warning>

      <para>There are many reasons for dumping and loading Subversion
        repository data.  Early in Subversion's life, the most common
        reason was due to the evolution of Subversion itself.  As
        Subversion matured, there were times when changes made to the
        back-end database schema caused compatibility issues with
        previous versions of the repository, so users had to dump
        their repository data using the previous version of
        Subversion, and load it into a freshly created repository with
        the new version of Subversion.  Now, these types of schema
        changes haven't occurred since Subversion's 1.0 release, and
        the Subversion developers promise not to force users to dump
        and load their repositories when upgrading between minor
        versions (such as from 1.3 to 1.4) of Subversion.  But there
        are still other reasons for dumping and loading, including
        re-deploying a Berkeley DB repository on a new OS or CPU
        architecture, switching between the Berkeley DB and FSFS
        back-ends, or (as we'll cover in <xref
        linkend="svn.reposadmin.maint.filtering" />) purging versioned
        data from repository history.</para>

      <para>Whatever your reason for migrating repository history,
        using the <command>svnadmin dump</command> and
        <command>svnadmin load</command> subcommands is
        straightforward.  <command>svnadmin dump</command> will output
        a range of repository revisions that are formatted using
        Subversion's custom filesystem dump format.  The dump format
        is printed to the standard output stream, while informative
        messages are printed to the standard error stream.  This
        allows you to redirect the output stream to a file while
        watching the status output in your terminal window.  For
        example:</para>

      <screen>
$ svnlook youngest myrepos
26
$ svnadmin dump myrepos &gt; dumpfile
* Dumped revision 0.
* Dumped revision 1.
* Dumped revision 2.
&hellip;
* Dumped revision 25.
* Dumped revision 26.
</screen>

      <para>At the end of the process, you will have a single file
        (<filename>dumpfile</filename> in the previous example) that
        contains all the data stored in your repository in the
        requested range of revisions.  Note that <command>svnadmin
        dump</command> is reading revision trees from the repository
        just like any other <quote>reader</quote> process would
        (<command>svn checkout</command>, for example), so it's safe
        to run this command at any time.</para>

      <para>The other subcommand in the pair, <command>svnadmin
        load</command>, parses the standard input stream as a
        Subversion repository dump file, and effectively replays those
        dumped revisions into the target repository for that
        operation.  It also gives informative feedback, this time
        using the standard output stream:</para>

      <screen>
$ svnadmin load newrepos &lt; dumpfile
&lt;&lt;&lt; Started new txn, based on original revision 1
     * adding path : A ... done.
     * adding path : A/B ... done.
     &hellip;
------- Committed new rev 1 (loaded from original rev 1) &gt;&gt;&gt;

&lt;&lt;&lt; Started new txn, based on original revision 2
     * editing path : A/mu ... done.
     * editing path : A/D/G/rho ... done.

     * editing path : A/mu ... done.

------- Committed new rev 26 (loaded from original rev 26) &gt;&gt;&gt;

      <para>The result of a load is new revisions added to a
        repository&mdash;the same thing you get by making commits
        against that repository from a regular Subversion client.  And
        just as in a commit, you can use hook programs to perform
        actions before and after each of the commits made during a
        load process.  By passing the
        <option>--use-pre-commit-hook</option> and
        <option>--use-post-commit-hook</option> options to
        <command>svnadmin load</command>, you can instruct Subversion
        to execute the pre-commit and post-commit hook programs,
        respectively, for each loaded revision.  You might use these,
        for example, to ensure that loaded revisions pass through the
        same validation steps that regular commits pass through.  Of
        course, you should use these options with care&mdash;if your
        post-commit hook sends emails to a mailing list for each new
        commit, you might not want to spew hundreds or thousands of
        commit emails in rapid succession at that list!  You can read more about the use of hook
        scripts in <xref
        linkend="svn.reposadmin.create.hooks"/>.</para>

      <para>Note that because <command>svnadmin</command> uses
        standard input and output streams for the repository dump and
        load process, people who are feeling especially saucy can try
        things like this (perhaps even using different versions of
        <command>svnadmin</command> on each side of the pipe):</para>
  
      <screen>
$ svnadmin create newrepos
$ svnadmin dump oldrepos | svnadmin load newrepos
</screen>

      <para>By default, the dump file will be quite large&mdash;much
        larger than the repository itself.  That's because by default
        every version of every file is expressed as a full text in the
        dump file.  This is the fastest and simplest behavior, and
        nice if you're piping the dump data directly into some other
        process (such as a compression program, filtering program, or
        into a loading process).  But if you're creating a dump file
        for longer-term storage, you'll likely want to save disk space
        by using the <option>--deltas</option> option.  With this
        option, successive revisions of files will be output as
        compressed, binary differences&mdash;just as file revisions
        are stored in a repository.  This option is slower, but
        results in a dump file much closer in size to the original
        repository.</para>

      <para>We mentioned previously that <command>svnadmin
        dump</command> outputs a range of revisions.  Use the
        <option>--revision (-r)</option> option to specify a single
        revision to dump, or a range of revisions.  If you omit this
        option, all the existing repository revisions will be
        dumped.</para>

      <screen>
$ svnadmin dump myrepos -r 23 &gt; rev-23.dumpfile
$ svnadmin dump myrepos -r 100:200 &gt; revs-100-200.dumpfile
</screen>

      <para>As Subversion dumps each new revision, it outputs only
        enough information to allow a future loader to re-create that
        revision based on the previous one.  In other words, for any
        given revision in the dump file, only the items that were
        changed in that revision will appear in the dump.  The only
        exception to this rule is the first revision that is dumped
        with the current <command>svnadmin dump</command>
        command.</para>

      <para>By default, Subversion will not express the first dumped
        revision as merely differences to be applied to the previous
        revision.  For one thing, there is no previous revision in the
        dump file!  And secondly, Subversion cannot know the state of
        the repository into which the dump data will be loaded (if it
        ever is).  To ensure that the output of each
        execution of <command>svnadmin dump</command> is
        self-sufficient, the first dumped revision is by default a
        full representation of every directory, file, and property in
        that revision of the repository.</para>

      <para>However, you can change this default behavior.  If you add
        the <option>--incremental</option> option when you dump your
        repository, <command>svnadmin</command> will compare the first
        dumped revision against the previous revision in the
        repository, the same way it treats every other revision that
        gets dumped.  It will then output the first revision exactly
        as it does the rest of the revisions in the dump
        range&mdash;mentioning only the changes that occurred in that
        revision.  The benefit of this is that you can create several
        small dump files that can be loaded in succession, instead of
        one large one, like so:</para>

      <screen>
$ svnadmin dump myrepos -r 0:1000 &gt; dumpfile1
$ svnadmin dump myrepos -r 1001:2000 --incremental &gt; dumpfile2
$ svnadmin dump myrepos -r 2001:3000 --incremental &gt; dumpfile3
</screen>

      <para>These dump files could be loaded into a new repository
        with the following command sequence:</para>

      <screen>
$ svnadmin load newrepos &lt; dumpfile1
$ svnadmin load newrepos &lt; dumpfile2
$ svnadmin load newrepos &lt; dumpfile3
</screen>

      <para>Another neat trick you can perform with this
        <option>--incremental</option> option involves appending to an
        existing dump file a new range of dumped revisions.  For
        example, you might have a <literal>post-commit</literal> hook
        that simply appends the repository dump of the single revision
        that triggered the hook.  Or you might have a script that runs
        nightly to append dump file data for all the revisions that
        were added to the repository since the last time the script
        ran.  Used like this, <command>svnadmin dump</command> can be
        one way to back up changes to your repository over time in case
        of a system crash or some other catastrophic event.</para>

      <para>The dump format can also be used to merge the contents of
        several different repositories into a single repository.  By
        using the <option>--parent-dir</option> option of
        <command>svnadmin load</command>, you can specify a new
        virtual root directory for the load process.  That means if
        you have dump files for three repositories, say
        <filename>calc-dumpfile</filename>,
        <filename>cal-dumpfile</filename>, and
        <filename>ss-dumpfile</filename>, you can first create a new
        repository to hold them all:</para>

      <screen>
$ svnadmin create /var/svn/projects
$
</screen>

      <para>Then, make new directories in the repository which will
        encapsulate the contents of each of the three previous
        repositories:</para>

      <screen>
$ svn mkdir -m "Initial project roots" \
      file:///var/svn/projects/calc \
      file:///var/svn/projects/calendar \
      file:///var/svn/projects/spreadsheet
Committed revision 1.
$ 
</screen>

      <para>Lastly, load the individual dump files into their
        respective locations in the new repository:</para>

      <screen>
$ svnadmin load /var/svn/projects --parent-dir calc &lt; calc-dumpfile
&hellip;
$ svnadmin load /var/svn/projects --parent-dir calendar &lt; cal-dumpfile
&hellip;
$ svnadmin load /var/svn/projects --parent-dir spreadsheet &lt; ss-dumpfile
&hellip;
$
</screen>

      <para>We'll mention one final way to use the Subversion
        repository dump format&mdash;conversion from a different
        storage mechanism or version control system altogether.
        Because the dump file format is, for the most part,
        human-readable, it should be relatively easy to describe
        generic sets of changes&mdash;each of which should be treated
        as a new revision&mdash;using this file format.  In fact, the
        <command>cvs2svn</command> utility (see <xref
        linkend="svn.forcvs.convert"/>) uses the dump format to
        represent the contents of a CVS repository so that those
        contents can be copied into a Subversion repository.</para>

    </sect2>

    <!-- =============================================================== -->
    <sect2 id="svn.reposadmin.maint.filtering">
      <title>Filtering Repository History</title>

      <para>Since Subversion stores your versioned history using, at
        the very least, binary differencing algorithms and data
        compression (optionally in a completely opaque database
        system), attempting manual tweaks is unwise, if not quite
        difficult, and at any rate strongly discouraged.  And once
        data has been stored in your repository, Subversion
        generally doesn't provide an easy way to remove that data.
        <footnote>
          <para>That's rather the reason you use version control at
            all, right?</para>
        </footnote>
        But inevitably, there will be times when you would like to
        manipulate the history of your repository.  You might need
        to strip out all instances of a file that was accidentally
        added to the repository (and shouldn't be there for whatever
        reason).
        <footnote>
          <para>Conscious, cautious removal of certain bits of
            versioned data is actually supported by real use-cases.
            That's why an <quote>obliterate</quote> feature has been
            one of the most highly requested Subversion features,
            and one which the Subversion developers hope to soon
            provide.</para>
        </footnote>
        Or, perhaps you have multiple projects sharing a
        single repository, and you decide to split them up into
        their own repositories.  To accomplish tasks like this,
        administrators need a more manageable and malleable
        representation of the data in their repositories&mdash;the
        Subversion repository dump format.</para>

      <para>As we described in <xref
        linkend="svn.reposadmin.maint.migrate" />, the
        Subversion repository dump format is a human-readable
        representation of the changes that you've made to your
        versioned data over time.  You use the <command>svnadmin
        dump</command> command to generate the dump data, and
        <command>svnadmin load</command> to populate a new
        repository with it (see <xref
        linkend="svn.reposadmin.maint.migrate"/>).  The great thing
        about the human-readability aspect of the dump format is
        that, if you aren't careless about it, you can manually
        inspect and modify it.  Of course, the downside is that if
        you have three years' worth of repository activity
        encapsulated in what is likely to be a very large dump file,
        it could take you a long, long time to manually inspect and
        modify it.</para>

      <para>That's where <command>svndumpfilter</command> becomes
        useful.  This program acts as path-based filter for
        repository dump streams.  Simply give it either a list of
        paths you wish to keep, or a list of paths you wish to not
        keep, then pipe your repository dump data through this
        filter.  The result will be a modified stream of dump data
        that contains only the versioned paths you (explicitly or
        implicitly) requested.</para>

      <para>Let's look a realistic example of how you might use this
        program.  We discuss elsewhere (see <xref
        linkend="svn.reposadmin.projects.chooselayout"/>) the
        process of deciding how to choose a layout for the data in
        your repositories&mdash;using one repository per project or
        combining them, arranging stuff within your repository, and
        so on.  But sometimes after new revisions start flying in,
        you rethink your layout and would like to make some changes.
        A common change is the decision to move multiple projects
        which are sharing a single repository into separate
        repositories for each project.</para>

      <para>Our imaginary repository contains three projects:
        <literal>calc</literal>, <literal>calendar</literal>, and
        <literal>spreadsheet</literal>.  They have been living
        side-by-side in a layout like this:</para>

      <screen>
/
   calc/
      trunk/
      branches/
      tags/
   calendar/
      trunk/
      branches/
      tags/
   spreadsheet/
      trunk/
      branches/
      tags/
</screen>

      <para>To get these three projects into their own repositories,
        we first dump the whole repository:</para>

      <screen>
$ svnadmin dump /var/svn/repos &gt; repos-dumpfile
* Dumped revision 0.
* Dumped revision 1.
* Dumped revision 2.
* Dumped revision 3.
&hellip;
$
</screen>

      <para>Next, run that dump file through the filter, each time
        including only one of our top-level directories, and
        resulting in three new dump files:</para>

      <screen>
$ svndumpfilter include calc &lt; repos-dumpfile &gt; calc-dumpfile
&hellip;
$ svndumpfilter include calendar &lt; repos-dumpfile &gt; cal-dumpfile
&hellip;
$ svndumpfilter include spreadsheet &lt; repos-dumpfile &gt; ss-dumpfile
&hellip;
$
</screen>

      <para>At this point, you have to make a decision.  Each of
        your dump files will create a valid repository,
        but will preserve the paths exactly as they were in the
        original repository.  This means that even though you would
        have a repository solely for your <literal>calc</literal>
        project, that repository would still have a top-level
        directory named <filename>calc</filename>.  If you want
        your <filename>trunk</filename>, <filename>tags</filename>,
        and <filename>branches</filename> directories to live in the
        root of your repository, you might wish to edit your
        dump files, tweaking the <literal>Node-path</literal> and
        <literal>Node-copyfrom-path</literal> headers to no longer have
        that first <filename>calc/</filename> path component.  Also,
        you'll want to remove the section of dump data that creates
        the <filename>calc</filename> directory.  It will look
        something like:</para>

      <screen>
Node-path: calc
Node-action: add
Node-kind: dir
Content-length: 0
  
</screen>

      <warning>
        <para>If you do plan on manually editing the dump file to
          remove a top-level directory, make sure that your editor is
          not set to automatically convert end-of-line characters to the native
          format (e.g. \r\n to \n), as the content will then not agree
          with the metadata.  This will render the dump file
          useless.</para>
      </warning>

      <para>All that remains now is to create your three new
        repositories, and load each dump file into the right
        repository:</para>

      <screen>
$ svnadmin create calc; svnadmin load calc &lt; calc-dumpfile
&lt;&lt;&lt; Started new transaction, based on original revision 1
     * adding path : Makefile ... done.
     * adding path : button.c ... done.
&hellip;
$ svnadmin create calendar; svnadmin load calendar &lt; cal-dumpfile
&lt;&lt;&lt; Started new transaction, based on original revision 1
     * adding path : Makefile ... done.
     * adding path : cal.c ... done.
&hellip;
$ svnadmin create spreadsheet; svnadmin load spreadsheet &lt; ss-dumpfile
&lt;&lt;&lt; Started new transaction, based on original revision 1
     * adding path : Makefile ... done.
     * adding path : ss.c ... done.
&hellip;
$
</screen>

      <para>Both of <command>svndumpfilter</command>'s subcommands
        accept options for deciding how to deal with
        <quote>empty</quote> revisions.  If a given revision
        contained only changes to paths that were filtered out, that
        now-empty revision could be considered uninteresting or even
        unwanted.  So to give the user control over what to do with
        those revisions, <command>svndumpfilter</command> provides
        the following command-line options:</para>

      <variablelist>
        <varlistentry>
          <term><option>--drop-empty-revs</option></term>
          <listitem>
            <para>Do not generate empty revisions at all&mdash;just
              omit them.</para>
          </listitem>
        </varlistentry>
        <varlistentry>
          <term><option>--renumber-revs</option></term>
          <listitem>
            <para>If empty revisions are dropped (using the
              <option>--drop-empty-revs</option> option), change the
              revision numbers of the remaining revisions so that
              there are no gaps in the numeric sequence.</para>
          </listitem>
        </varlistentry>
        <varlistentry>
          <term><option>--preserve-revprops</option></term>
          <listitem>
            <para>If empty revisions are not dropped, preserve the
              revision properties (log message, author, date, custom
              properties, etc.) for those empty revisions.
              Otherwise, empty revisions will only contain the
              original datestamp, and a generated log message that
              indicates that this revision was emptied by
              <command>svndumpfilter</command>.</para>
          </listitem>
        </varlistentry>
      </variablelist>
      
      <para>While <command>svndumpfilter</command> can be very
        useful, and a huge timesaver, there are unfortunately a
        couple of gotchas.  First, this utility is overly sensitive
        to path semantics.  Pay attention to whether paths in your
        dump file are specified with or without leading slashes.
        You'll want to look at the <literal>Node-path</literal> and
        <literal>Node-copyfrom-path</literal> headers.</para>

      <screen>
&hellip;
Node-path: spreadsheet/Makefile
&hellip;
</screen>

      <para>If the paths have leading slashes, you should
        include leading slashes in the paths you pass to
        <command>svndumpfilter include</command> and
        <command>svndumpfilter exclude</command> (and if they don't,
        you shouldn't).  Further, if your dump file has an inconsistent
        usage of leading slashes for some reason,
        <footnote>
          <para>While <command>svnadmin dump</command> has a
            consistent leading slash policy&mdash;to not include
            them&mdash;other programs which generate dump data might
            not be so consistent.</para>
        </footnote>
        you should probably normalize those paths so they all
        have, or lack, leading slashes.</para>

      <para>Also, copied paths can give you some trouble.
        Subversion supports copy operations in the repository, where
        a new path is created by copying some already existing path.
        It is possible that at some point in the lifetime of your
        repository, you might have copied a file or directory from
        some location that <command>svndumpfilter</command> is
        excluding, to a location that it is including.  In order to
        make the dump data self-sufficient,
        <command>svndumpfilter</command> needs to still show the
        addition of the new path&mdash;including the contents of any
        files created by the copy&mdash;and not represent that
        addition as a copy from a source that won't exist in your
        filtered dump data stream.  But because the Subversion
        repository dump format only shows what was changed in each
        revision, the contents of the copy source might not be
        readily available.  If you suspect that you have any copies
        of this sort in your repository, you might want to rethink
        your set of included/excluded paths, perhaps including the
        paths that served as sources of your troublesome copy
        operations, too.</para>

      <para>Finally, <command>svndumpfilter</command> takes path
        filtering quite literally.  If you are trying to copy the
        history of a project rooted at
        <filename>trunk/my-project</filename> and move it into a
        repository of its own, you would, of course, use the
        <command>svndumpfilter include</command> command to keep all
        the changes in and under
        <filename>trunk/my-project</filename>.  But the resulting
        dump file makes no assumptions about the repository into
        which you plan to load this data.  Specifically, the dump
        data might begin with the revision which added the
        <filename>trunk/my-project</filename> directory, but it will
        <emphasis>not</emphasis> contain directives which would
        create the <filename>trunk</filename> directory itself
        (because <filename>trunk</filename> doesn't match the
        include filter).  You'll need to make sure that any
        directories which the new dump stream expect to exist
        actually do exist in the target repository before trying to
        load the stream into that repository.</para>

      <title>Repository Replication</title>

      <para>There are several scenarios in which it is quite handy to
        have a Subversion repository whose version history is exactly
        the same as some other repository's.  Perhaps the most obvious
        one is the maintenance of a simple backup repository, used
        when the primary repository has become inaccessible due to a
        hardware failure, network outage, or other such annoyance.
        Other scenarios include deploying mirror repositories to
        distribute heavy Subversion load across multiple servers, use
        as a soft-upgrade mechanism, and so on.</para>

      <para>As of version 1.4, Subversion provides a program for
        managing scenarios like
        these&mdash;<command>svnsync</command>.
        <command>svnsync</command> works by essentially asking the
        Subversion server to <quote>replay</quote> revisions, one at a
        time.  It then uses that revision information to mimic a
        commit of the same to another repository.  Neither repository
        needs to be locally accessible to machine on which
        <command>svnsync</command> is running&mdash;its parameters are
        repository URLs, and it does all its work through Subversion's
        repository access (RA) interfaces.  All it requires is read
        access to the source repository and read/write access to the
        destination repository.</para>

      <note>
        <para>When using <command>svnsync</command> against a remote
          source repository, the Subversion server for that repository
          must be running Subversion version 1.4 or better.</para>
      </note>

      <para>Assuming you already have a source repository that you'd
        like to mirror, the next thing you need is an empty target
        repository which will actually serve as that mirror.  This
        target repository can use either of the available filesystem
        data-store back-ends (see <xref
        linkend="svn.reposadmin.basics.backends" />), but it must not
        yet have any version history in it.  The protocol via which
        <command>svnsync</command> communicates revision information
        is highly sensitive to mismatches between the versioned
        histories contained in the source and target repositories.
        For this reason, while <command>svnsync</command> cannot
        <emphasis>demand</emphasis> that the target repository be
        read-only,
        <footnote>
          <para>In fact, it can't truly be read-only, or
            <command>svnsync</command> itself would have a tough time
            copying revision history into it.</para>
        </footnote>
        allowing the revision history in the target repository to
        change by any mechanism other than the mirroring process is a
        recipe for disaster.</para>

      <warning>
        <para>Do <emphasis>not</emphasis> modify a mirror repository
          in such a way as to cause its version history to deviate
          from that of the repository it mirrors.  The only commits
          and revision property modifications that ever occur on that
          mirror repository should be those performed by the
          <command>svnsync</command> tool.</para>
      </warning>

      <para>Another requirement of the target repository is that the
        <command>svnsync</command> process be allowed to modify
        certain revision properties.  <command>svnsync</command>
        stores its bookkeeping information in special revision
        properties on revision 0 of the destination repository.
        Because <command>svnsync</command> works within the framework
        of that repository's hook system, the default state of the
        repository (which is to disallow revision property changes;
        see <xref linkend="svn.ref.reposhooks.pre-revprop-change" />)
        is insufficient.  You'll need to explicitly implement the
        pre-revprop-change hook, and your script must allow
        <command>svnsync</command> to set and change its special
        properties.  With those provisions in place, you are ready to
        start mirroring repository revisions.</para>

      <tip>
        <para>It's a good idea to implement authorization measures
          which allow your repository replication process to perform
          its tasks while preventing other users from modifying the
          contents of your mirror repository at all.</para>
      </tip>

      <para>Let's walk through the use of <command>svnsync</command>
        in a somewhat typical mirroring scenario.  We'll pepper this
        discourse with practical recommendations which you are free to
        disregard if they aren't required by or suitable for your
        environment.</para>

      <para>As a service to the fine developers of our favorite
        version control system, we will be mirroring the public
        Subversion source code repository and exposing that mirror
        publicly on the Internet, hosted on a different machine than
        the one on which the original Subversion source code
        repository lives.  This remote host has a global configuration
        which permits anonymous users to read the contents of
        repositories on the host, but requires users to authenticate
        in order to modify those repositories.  (Please forgive us for
        glossing over the details of Subversion server configuration
        for the moment&mdash;those are covered thoroughly in <xref
        linkend="svn.serverconfig" />.)  And for no other reason than
        that it makes for a more interesting example, we'll be driving
        the replication process from a third machine, the one which
        we currently find ourselves using.</para>

      <para>First, we'll create the repository which will be our
        mirror.  This and the next couple of steps do require shell
        access to the machine on which the mirror repository will
        live.  Once the repository is all configured, though, we
        shouldn't need to touch it directly again.</para>

      <screen>
$ ssh admin@svn.example.com \
      "svnadmin create /var/svn/svn-mirror"
admin@svn.example.com's password: ********
$
</screen>

      <para>At this point, we have our repository, and due to our
        server's configuration, that repository is now
        <quote>live</quote> on the Internet.  Now, because we don't
        want anything modifying the repository except our replication
        process, we need a way to distinguish that process from other
        would-be committers.  To do so, we use a dedicated username
        for our process.  Only commits and revision property
        modifications performed by the special username
        <literal>syncuser</literal> will be allowed.</para>

      <para>We'll use the repository's hook system both to allow the
        replication process to do what it needs to do, and to enforce
        that only it is doing those things.  We accomplish this by
        implementing two of the repository event
        hooks&mdash;pre-revprop-change and start-commit.  Our
        <filename>pre-revprop-change</filename> hook script is found
        in <xref
        linkend="svn.reposadmin.maint.replication.pre-revprop-change"
        />, and basically verifies that the user attempting the
        property changes is our <literal>syncuser</literal> user.  If
        so, the change is allowed; otherwise, it is denied.</para>

      <example id="svn.reposadmin.maint.replication.pre-revprop-change">
        <title>Mirror repository's pre-revprop-change hook script</title>

        <programlisting>
#!/bin/sh 

USER="$3"

if [ "$USER" = "syncuser" ]; then exit 0; fi

echo "Only the syncuser user may change revision properties" >&amp;2
exit 1
</programlisting>
      </example>

      <para>That covers revision property changes.  Now we need to
        ensure that only the <literal>syncuser</literal> user is
        permitted to commit new revisions to the repository.  We do
        this using a <filename>start-commit</filename> hook scripts
        like the one in <xref
        linkend="svn.reposadmin.maint.replication.start-commit"
        />.</para>

      <example id="svn.reposadmin.maint.replication.start-commit">
        <title>Mirror repository's start-commit hook script</title>

        <programlisting>
#!/bin/sh 

USER="$2"

if [ "$USER" = "syncuser" ]; then exit 0; fi

echo "Only the syncuser user may commit new revisions" >&amp;2
exit 1
</programlisting>
      </example>

      <para>After installing our hook scripts and ensuring that they
        are executable by the Subversion server, we're finished with
        the setup of the mirror repository.  Now, we get to actually
        do the mirroring.</para>

      <para>The first thing we need to do with
        <command>svnsync</command> is to register in our target
        repository the fact that it will be a mirror of the source
        repository.  We do this using the <command>svnsync
        initialize</command> subcommand.</para>

      <screen>
$ svnsync help init
initialize (init): usage: svnsync initialize DEST_URL SOURCE_URL

Initialize a destination repository for synchronization from
another repository.
&hellip;
$ svnsync initialize http://svn.example.com/svn-mirror \
                     http://svn.collab.net/repos/svn \
                     --sync-username syncuser --sync-password syncpass
Copied properties for revision 0.
$
</screen>

      <para>Our target repository will now remember that it is a
        mirror of the public Subversion source code repository.
        Notice that we provided a username and password as arguments
        to <command>svnsync</command>&mdash;that was required by the
        pre-revprop-change hook on our mirror repository.</para>

      <note>
        <para>The URLs provided to <command>svnsync</command> must
          point to the root directories of the target and source
          repositories, respectively.  The tool does not handle
          mirroring of repository subtrees.</para>
      </note>

      <note>
        <para>In Subversion 1.4, the values
          given to <command>svnsync</command>'s <option>--username</option> and
          <option>--password</option> command-line options were used
          for authentication against both the source and destination
          repositories.  This caused problems when a user's
          credentials weren't exactly the same for both repositories,
          especially when running in non-interactive
          mode (with the <option>--non-interactive</option> option)
          might experience problems.</para>

        <para>This has been fixed in Subversion 1.5 with the
          introduction of two new pairs of options.  Use the
          <option>--source-username</option> and
          <option>--source-password</option> options to provide
          authentication credentials for the source repository; use
          <option>--sync-username</option> and
          <option>--sync-password</option> to provide credentials for
          the destination repository.  (The old
          <command>--username</command> and
          <command>--password</command> options still exist for
          compatibility, but we advise against using them.)</para>

      </note>

      <para>And now comes the fun part.  With a single subcommand, we
        can tell <command>svnsync</command> to copy all the
        as-yet-unmirrored revisions from the source repository to the
        target.
        <footnote>
          <para>Be forewarned that while it will take only a few
            seconds for the average reader to parse this paragraph and
            the sample output which follows it, the actual time
            required to complete such a mirroring operation is, shall
            we say, quite a bit longer.</para>
        </footnote>
        The <command>svnsync synchronize</command> subcommand will
        peek into the special revision properties previously stored on
        the target repository, and determine what repository it is
        mirroring and that the most recently mirrored revision was
        revision 0.  Then it will query the source repository and
        determine what the latest revision in that repository is.
        Finally, it asks the source repository's server to start
        replaying all the revisions between 0 and that latest
        revision.  As <command>svnsync</command> get the resulting
        response from the source repository's server, it begins
        forwarding those revisions to the target repository's server
        as new commits.</para>

      <screen>
$ svnsync help synchronize
synchronize (sync): usage: svnsync synchronize DEST_URL

Transfer all pending revisions to the destination from the source
with which it was initialized.
&hellip;
$ svnsync synchronize http://svn.example.com/svn-mirror
Transmitting file data ........................................

</screen>

      <para>Of particular interest here is that for each mirrored
        revision, there is first a commit of that revision to the
        target repository, and then property changes follow.  This is
        because the initial commit is performed by (and attributed to)
        the user <literal>syncuser</literal>, and datestamped with the
        time as of that revision's creation.  Also, Subversion's
        underlying repository access interfaces don't provide a
        mechanism for setting arbitrary revision properties as part of
        a commit.  So <command>svnsync</command> follows up with an
        immediate series of property modifications which copy all the
        revision properties found for that revision in the source
        repository into the target repository.  This also has the
        effect of fixing the author and datestamp of the revision
        to match that of the source repository.</para>

      <para>Also noteworthy is that <command>svnsync</command>
        performs careful bookkeeping that allows it to be safely
        interrupted and restarted without ruining the integrity of the
        mirrored data.  If a network glitch occurs while mirroring a
        repository, simply repeat the <command>svnsync
        synchronize</command> command and it will happily pick up
        right where it left off.  In fact, as new revisions appear in
        the source repository, this is exactly what you to do
        in order to keep your mirror up-to-date.</para>

      <para>There is, however, one bit of inelegance in the process.
        Because Subversion revision properties can be changed at any
        time throughout the lifetime of the repository, and don't
        leave an audit trail that indicates when they were changed,
        replication processes have to pay special attention to them.
        If you've already mirrored the first 15 revisions of a
        repository and someone then changes a revision property on
        revision 12, <command>svnsync</command> won't know to go back
        and patch up its copy of revision 12.  You'll need to tell it
        to do so manually by using (or with some additionally tooling
        around) the <command>svnsync copy-revprops</command>
        subcommand, which simply re-replicates all the revision
        properties for a particular revision or range thereof.</para>

      <screen>
$ svnsync help copy-revprops
copy-revprops: usage: svnsync copy-revprops DEST_URL [REV[:REV2]]

Copy the revision properties in a given range of revisions to the
destination from the source with which it was initialized.
&hellip;
$ svnsync copy-revprops http://svn.example.com/svn-mirror 12
Copied properties for revision 12.
$
</screen>

      <para>That's repository replication in a nutshell.  You'll
        likely want some automation around such a process.  For
        example, while our example was a pull-and-push setup, you
        might wish to have your primary repository push changes to one
        or more blessed mirrors as part of its post-commit and
        post-revprop-change hook implementations.  This would enable
        the mirror to be up-to-date in as near to realtime as is
        likely possible.</para>

      <para>Also, while it isn't very commonplace to do so,
        <command>svnsync</command> does gracefully mirror repositories
        in which the user as whom it authenticates only has partial
        read access.  It simply copies only the bits of the repository
        that it is permitted to see.  Obviously such a mirror is not
        useful as a backup solution.</para>

      <para>As far as user interaction with repositories and mirrors
        goes, it <emphasis>is</emphasis> possible to have a single
        working copy that interacts with both, but you'll have to jump
        through some hoops to make it happen.  First, you need to
        ensure that both the primary and mirror repositories have the
        same repository UUID (which is not the case by default).  See
        <xref linkend="svn.reposadmin.maint.uuids" /> for more about
        managing repository UUIDs.</para>
        
      <para>Once the two repositories have the same UUID, you can
        use <command>svn switch --relocate</command> to point your
        working copy to whichever of the repositories you wish to
        operate against, a process which is described in <xref
        linkend="svn.ref.svn.c.switch" />.  There is a possible danger
        here, though, in that if the primary and mirror repositories
        aren't in close synchronization, a working copy up-to-date
        with, and pointing to, the primary repository will, if
        relocated to point to an out-of-date mirror, become confused
        about the apparent sudden loss of revisions it fully expects
        to be present, and throws errors to that effect.  If this
        occurs, you can relocate your working copy back to the primary
        repository and then either wait until the mirror repository is
        up-to-date, or backdate your working copy to a revision you
        know is present in the sync repository and then retry the
        relocation.</para>

      <para>Finally, be aware that the revision-based replication
        provided by <command>svnsync</command> is only
        that&mdash;replication of revisions.  It does not include such
        things as the hook implementations, repository or server
        configuration data, uncommitted transactions, or information
        about user locks on repository paths.  Only information
        carried by the Subversion repository dump file format is
        available for replication.</para>

    <!-- =============================================================== -->
    <sect2 id="svn.reposadmin.maint.backup">
      <title>Repository Backup</title>

      <para>Despite numerous advances in technology since the birth of
        the modern computer, one thing unfortunately rings true with
        crystalline clarity&mdash;sometimes, things go very, very
        awry.  Power outages, network connectivity dropouts, corrupt
        RAM and crashed hard drives are but a taste of the evil that
        Fate is poised to unleash on even the most conscientious
        administrator.  And so we arrive at a very important
        topic&mdash;how to make backup copies of your repository
        data.</para>

      <para>There are two types of backup methods available for
        Subversion repository administrators&mdash;full and
        incremental.  A full backup of the repository involves
        squirreling away in one sweeping action all the information
        required to fully reconstruct that repository in the event of
        a catastrophe.  Usually, it means, quite literally, the
        duplication of the entire repository directory (which includes
        either a Berkeley DB or FSFS environment).  Incremental
        backups are lesser things, backups of only the portion of the
        repository data that has changed since the previous
        backup.</para>

      <para>As far as full backups go, the naive approach might seem
        like a sane one, but unless you temporarily disable all other
        access to your repository, simply doing a recursive directory
        copy runs the risk of generating a faulty backup.  In the case
        of Berkeley DB, the documentation describes a certain order in
        which database files can be copied that will guarantee a valid
        backup copy.  A similar ordering exists for FSFS data.  But
        you don't have to implement these algorithms yourself, because
        the Subversion development team has already done so.  The
        <command>svnadmin hotcopy</command> command takes care of the
        minutia involved in making a hot backup of your repository.
        And its invocation is as trivial as Unix's
        <command>cp</command> or Windows' <command>copy</command>
        operations:</para>

      <screen>
$ svnadmin hotcopy /var/svn/repos /var/svn/repos-backup
</screen>

      <para>The resulting backup is a fully functional Subversion
        repository, able to be dropped in as a replacement for your
        live repository should something go horribly wrong.</para>

      <para>When making copies of a Berkeley DB repository, you can
        even instruct <command>svnadmin hotcopy</command> to purge any
        unused Berkeley DB logfiles (see <xref
        linkend="svn.reposadmin.maint.diskspace.bdblogs" />) from the
        original repository upon completion of the copy.  Simply
        provide the <option>--clean-logs</option> option on the
        command-line.</para>

      <screen>
$ svnadmin hotcopy --clean-logs /var/svn/bdb-repos /var/svn/bdb-repos-backup
</screen>

      <para>Additional tooling around this command is available, too.
        The <filename>tools/backup/</filename> directory of the
        Subversion source distribution holds the
        <command>hot-backup.py</command> script.  This script adds a
        bit of backup management atop <command>svnadmin
        hotcopy</command>, allowing you to keep only the most recent
        configured number of backups of each repository.  It will
        automatically manage the names of the backed-up repository
        directories to avoid collisions with previous backups, and
        will <quote>rotate off</quote> older backups, deleting them so
        only the most recent ones remain.  Even if you also have an
        incremental backup, you might want to run this program on a
        regular basis.  For example, you might consider using
        <command>hot-backup.py</command> from a program scheduler
        (such as <command>cron</command> on Unix systems) which will
        cause it to run nightly (or at whatever granularity of Time
        you deem safe).</para>

      <para>Some administrators use a different backup mechanism built
        around generating and storing repository dump data.  We
        described in <xref linkend="svn.reposadmin.maint.migrate" />
        how to use <command>svnadmin dump --incremental</command> to
        perform an incremental backup of a given revision or range of
        revisions.  And of course, there is a full backup variation of
        this achieved by omitting the <option>--incremental</option>
        option to that command.  There is some value in these methods,
        in that the format of your backed-up information is
        flexible&mdash;it's not tied to a particular platform,
        versioned filesystem type, or release of Subversion or
        Berkeley DB.  But that flexibility comes at a cost, namely
        that restoring that data can take a long time&mdash;longer
        with each new revision committed to your repository.  Also, as
        is the case with so many of the various backup methods,
        revision property changes made to already-backed-up revisions
        won't get picked up by a non-overlapping, incremental dump
        generation.  For these reasons, we recommend against relying
        solely on dump-based backup approaches.</para>

      <para>As you can see, each of the various backup types and
        methods has its advantages and disadvantages.  The easiest is
        by far the full hot backup, which will always result in a
        perfect working replica of your repository.  Should something
        bad happen to your live repository, you can restore from the
        backup with a simple recursive directory copy.  Unfortunately,
        if you are maintaining multiple backups of your repository,
        these full copies will each eat up just as much disk space as
        your live repository.  Incremental backups, by contrast, tend
        to be quicker to generate and smaller to store.  But the
        restoration process can be a pain, often involving applying
        multiple incremental backups.  And other methods have their
        own peculiarities.  Administrators need to find the balance
        between the cost of making the backup and the cost of
        restoring it.</para>

      <para>The <command>svnsync</command> program (see <xref
        linkend="svn.reposadmin.maint.replication" />) actually
        provides a rather handy middle-ground approach.  If you are
        regularly synchronizing a read-only mirror with your main
        repository, then in a pinch, your read-only mirror is probably
        a good candidate for replacing that main repository if it
        falls over.  The primary disadvantage of this method is that
        only the versioned repository data gets
        synchronized&mdash;repository configuration files,
        user-specified repository path locks, and other items which
        might live in the physical repository directory but not
        <emphasis>inside</emphasis> the repository's virtual versioned
        filesystem are not handled by svnsync.</para>

      <para>In any backup scenario, repository administrators need
        to be aware of how modifications to unversioned revision
        properties affect their backups.  Since these changes do not
        themselves generate new revisions, they will not trigger
        post-commit hooks, and may not even trigger the
        pre-revprop-change and post-revprop-change hooks.
        <footnote>
          <para><command>svnadmin setlog</command> can be called in a
            way that bypasses the hook interface altogether.</para>
        </footnote>  
        And since you can change revision properties without respect
        to chronological order&mdash;you can change any revision's
        properties at any time&mdash;an incremental backup of the
        latest few revisions might not catch a property modification
        to a revision that was included as part of a previous 
        backup.</para>

      <para>Generally speaking, only the truly paranoid would need to
        backup their entire repository, say, every time a commit
        occurred.  However, assuming that a given repository has some
        other redundancy mechanism in place with relatively fine
        granularity (like per-commit emails or incremental dumps), a
        hot backup of the database might be something that a
        repository administrator would want to include as part of a
        system-wide nightly backup.  It's your data&mdash;protect it
        as much as you'd like.</para>
            
      <para>Often, the best approach to repository backups is a
        diversified one which leverages combinations of the methods
        described here.  The Subversion developers, for example, back
        up the Subversion source code repository nightly using
        <command>hot-backup.py</command> and an offsite
        <command>rsync</command> of those full backups; keep multiple
        archives of all the commit and property change notification
        emails; and have repository mirrors maintained by various
        volunteers using <command>svnsync</command>.  Your solution
        might be similar, but should be catered to your needs and that
        delicate balance of convenience with paranoia.  And whatever
        you do, validate your backups from time to time&mdash;what
        good is a spare tire that has a hole in it?  While all of this
        might not save your hardware from the iron fist of Fate,
        <footnote>
          <para>You know&mdash;the collective term for all of her
            <quote>fickle fingers</quote>.</para>

      <title>Managing Repository UUIDs</title>

      <para>Subversion repositories have a universally unique
        identifier (UUID) associated with them.  This is used by
        Subversion clients to verify the identity of a repository when
        other forms of verification aren't good enough (such as
        checking the repository URL, which can change over time).
        Most Subversion repository administrators rarely, if ever,
        need to think about repository UUIDs as anything more than a
        trivial implementation detail of Subversion.  Sometimes,
        however, there is cause for attention to this detail.</para>

      <para>As a general rule, you want the UUIDs of your live
        repositories to be unique.  That is, after all, the point of
        having UUIDs.  But there are times when you want the
        repository UUIDs of two repositories to be exactly the same.
        For example, if you make a copy of a repository for backup
        purposes, you want the backup to be a perfect replica of the
        original so that, in the event that you have to restore that
        backup and replace the live repository, users don't suddenly
        see what looks like a different repository.  When dumping and
        loading repository history (as described in <xref
        linkend="svn.reposadmin.maint.migrate" />), you get to decide
        whether or not to apply the UUID encapsulated in the data dump
        stream to the repository you are loading the data into.  The
        particular circumstance will dictate the correct
        behavior.</para>

      <para>There are a couple of ways to set (or reset) a
        repository's UUID, should you need to.  As of Subversion 1.5,
        this is as simple as using the <command>svnadmin
        setuuid</command> command.  If you provide this subcommand
        with an explicit UUID, it will validate that the UUID is
        well-formed and then set the repository UUID to that value.
        If you omit the UUID, a brand new UUID will be generated for
        your repository.</para>

      <screen>
$ svnlook uuid /var/svn/repos
cf2b9d22-acb5-11dc-bc8c-05e83ce5dbec
$ svnadmin setuuid /var/svn/repos   # generate a new UUID
$ svnlook uuid /var/svn/repos
3c3c38fe-acc0-11dc-acbc-1b37ff1c8e7c
$ svnadmin setuuid /var/svn/repos \
           cf2b9d22-acb5-11dc-bc8c-05e83ce5dbec  # restore the old UUID
$ svnlook uuid /var/svn/repos
cf2b9d22-acb5-11dc-bc8c-05e83ce5dbec
$
</screen>

      <para>For folks using versions of Subversion earlier than 1.5,
        these tasks are a little more complicated.  You can set an
        explicit UUID on a repository by creating a stub repository
        dump file that carries that UUID specification, and then
        loading that into your repository with the
        <option>--force-uuid</option> option to <command>svnadmin
        load</command>.</para>

      <screen>
$ cat - &lt;&lt;EOF | svnadmin load --force-uuid /var/snv/repos
SVN-fs-dump-format-version: 2

UUID: cf2b9d22-acb5-11dc-bc8c-05e83ce5dbec
EOF
$
</screen>

      <para>Having older versions of Subversion generate a brand new
        UUID is not quite as simple to do, though.  Your best bet here
        is to find some other way to generate a UUID, and then
        explicitly set the repository's UUID to that value.</para>

    <title>Moving and Removing Repositories</title>

    <para>Subversion repository data is wholly contained within the
      repository directory.  As such, you can move a Subversion
      repository to some other location on disk, rename a repository,
      copy a repository, or delete a repository altogether using the
      tools provided by your operating system for manipulating
      directories&mdash;<command>mv</command>, <command>cp
      -a</command>, and <command>rm -r</command> on Unix platforms;
      <command>copy</command>, <command>move</command> and
      <command>rmdir /s /q</command> on Windows; vast numbers of mouse
      and menu gyrations in various graphical file explorer
      applications, and so on.</para>

    <para>Of course, there's often still more to be done when trying
      to cleanly affect changes like this.  For example, you might
      need to update your Subversion server configuration to point to
      the new location of a relocated repository, or to remove
      configuration bits for a now-deleted repository.  If you have
      automated processes that publish information from or about your
      repositories, they may need to be updated.  Hook scripts might
      need to be reconfigured.  Users need to be notified.  The list
      can go on indefinitely, or at least to the extent that you've
      built processes and procedures around your Subversion
      repository.</para>

    <para>In the case of a copied repository, you should also consider
      the fact that Subversion uses repository UUIDs to distinguish
      repositories.  If you copy a Subversion repository using a
      typical shell recursive copy command, you'll wind up with two
      repositories identical in every way&mdash;including their UUIDs.
      In some circumstances, this might be desirable.  But in the
      instances where it is not, you'll need to generate a new UUID
      for one of these identical repositories.  See <xref
      linkend="svn.reposadmin.maint.uuids" /> for more about managing
      repository UUIDs.</para>
