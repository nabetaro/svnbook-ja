  <title>Server Configuration</title>

  <para>A Subversion repository can be accessed simultaneously by
    clients running on the same machine on which the repository
    resides using the <literal>file://</literal> method.  But the
    typical Subversion setup involves a single server machine being
    accessed from clients on computers all over the office&mdash;or,
    perhaps, all over the world.</para>

  <para>This chapter describes how to get your Subversion repository
    exposed outside its host machine for use by remote clients.  We
    will cover Subversion's currently available server mechanisms,
    discussing the configuration and use of each.  After reading
    this section, you should be able to decide which networking
    setup is right for your needs, and understand how to enable such
    a setup on your host computer.</para>

    <title>Overview</title>

    <para>Subversion was designed with an abstract network layer.
      This means that a repository can be programmatically accessed by
      any sort of server process, and the client <quote>repository
      access</quote> API allows programmers to write plugins that
      speak relevant network protocols.  In theory, Subversion can use
      an infinite number of network implementations.  In practice,
      there are only two servers at the time of this writing.</para>

    <para>Apache is an extremely popular webserver; using the
      <command>mod_dav_svn</command> module, Apache can access a
      repository and make it available to clients via the
      WebDAV/DeltaV protocol, which is an extension of HTTP.  In the
      other corner is <command>svnserve</command>: a small, standalone
      server program that speaks a custom protocol with clients.
      <xref linkend="svn.serverconfig.overview.tbl-1"/> presents a
      comparison of the two servers.</para>

      <title>Choosing the Best Server Configuration</title>

      <para>So, which server should you use?  Which is best?</para>

      <para>Obviously, there's no right answer to that question.
        Every team has different needs, and the different servers all
        represent different sets of tradeoffs.  The Subversion project
        itself doesn't endorse one server or another, or consider
        either server more <quote>official</quote> than
        another.</para>

      <para>In general, the authors of this book recommend a vanilla
        <command>svnserve</command> installation for small teams just
        trying to get started with a Subversion server; it's the
        simplest to set up, and has the fewest maintenance issues.
        Remember, you can always switch to a more complex server
        deployment as your needs change.</para>

      <para>Here are some general recommendations, based on years of
        supporting users:</para>

      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>If you're trying to set up the simplest possible
            server for your group, then a
            vanilla <command>svnserve</command> installation is the
            easiest, fastest route.  Note, however, that your
            repository data will be transmitted in the clear over the
            network.  If your deployment is entirely within your
            company's LAN or VPN, this isn't an issue.  If the
            repository is exposed to the wide-open internet, then you
            might want to make sure the repository's contents aren't
            sensitive (e.g. it contains only open-source code.)</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>If you need to integrate with existing identity
            systems (LDAP, Active Directory, NTLM, X.509, etc.), then
            an Apache-based server is your only real option.
            Similarly, if you absolutely need server-side logs of
            either server errors or client activities, then an
            Apache-based server is required.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
           <para>If you've decided to use either Apache or stock
             <command>svnserve</command>, create a
             single <literal>svn</literal> user on your system and run
             the server process as that user.  Be sure to make the
             repository directory wholly owned by
             the <literal>svn</literal> user as well.  From a security
             point of view, this keeps the repository data nicely
             siloed and protected by operating system filesystem
             permissions, changeable by only the Subversion server
             process itself.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>If you have an existing infrastructure heavily based
            on SSH accounts, and if your users already have system
            accounts on your server machine, then it makes sense to
            deploy an svnserve-over-ssh solution.  Otherwise, we don't
            widely recommend this option to the public.  It's
            generally considered safer to have your users access the
            repository via (imaginary) accounts managed
            by <command>svnserve</command> or Apache, rather than by
            full-blown system accounts.  If your deep desire for
            encrypted communication still draws you to this option, we
            recommend using Apache with SSL instead.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>Do <emphasis>not</emphasis> be seduced by the simple
            idea of having all of your users access a repository
            directly via <literal>file:///</literal> URLs.  Even if
            the repository is readily available to everyone via
            network share, this is a bad idea.  It removes any layers
            of protection between the users and the repository: users
            can accidentally (or intentionally) corrupt the repository
            database, it becomes hard to take the repository offline
            for inspection or upgrade, and it can lead to a mess of
            file-permissions problems (see
            <xref linkend="svn.serverconfig.multimethod"/>.)  Note
            that this is also one of the reasons we warn against
            accessing repositories via <literal>svn+ssh://</literal>
            URLs &mdash; from a security standpoint, it's effectively
            the same as local users accessing
            via <literal>file:///</literal>, and can entail all the
            same problems if the administrator isn't careful.</para>

        <title><command>svnserve</command> as Daemon</title>

        <para>The easiest option is to run <command>svnserve</command>
          as a standalone <quote>daemon</quote> process.  Use the
          <option>-d</option> option for this:</para>

        <screen>
$ svnserve -d
$               # svnserve is now running, listening on port 3690
</screen>

        <para>When running <command>svnserve</command> in daemon mode,
          you can use the <option>--listen-port=</option> and
          <option>--listen-host=</option> options to customize the
          exact port and hostname to <quote>bind</quote> to.</para>

      <para>Once the <command>svnserve</command> program is running,
        it makes every repository on your system available to the
        network.  A client needs to specify an
        <emphasis>absolute</emphasis> path in the repository URL.  For
        example, if a repository is located at
        <filename>/usr/local/repositories/project1</filename>, then a
        client would reach it via
        <uri>svn://host.example.com/usr/local/repositories/project1</uri>.
        To increase security, you can pass the <option>-r</option>
        option to <command>svnserve</command>, which restricts it to
        exporting only repositories below that path.  For example:</para>
      
      <screen>
$ svnserve -d -r /usr/local/repositories
&hellip;
</screen>

      <para>Using the <option>-r</option> option effectively
        modifies the location that the program treats as the root of
        the remote filesystem space.  Clients then use URLs that
        have that path portion removed from them, leaving much
        shorter (and much less revealing) URLs:</para>

      <screen>
$ svn checkout svn://host.example.com/project1

        <para>If your Windows system is a descendant of Windows NT
          (2000, 2003, XP, Vista), then you can
          run <command>svnserve</command> as a standard Windows
          service.  You'll need to define the service using a
          command-line tool <command>SC.EXE</command>.  Much like
          the <command>inetd</command> configuration line, you must
          specify an exact invocation of <command>svnserve</command>
          for Windows to run at start-up time:</para>

        <screen>
C:\&gt; sc create svn

        <para>This defines a new Windows service
          named <quote>svn</quote>, and which executes a
          particular <command>svnserve.exe</command> command when
          started.  There are a number of caveats in the prior
          example, however.</para>

        <para>First, notice that the <command>svnserve.exe</command>
          program is always invoked with
          the <option>--service</option> option.  You must always
          specify this option, and you may <emphasis>not</emphasis>
          specify other conflicting options such
          as <option>--daemon</option>, <option>--tunnel</option>,
          or <option>--inetd</option>.  Options such
          as <option>-r</option> or <option>--listen-port</option> are
          fine.  Second, be careful about spaces when invoking
          the <command>SC.EXE</command> command: the
          <literal>key= value</literal> patterns must have no
          spaces between <literal>key=</literal> and exactly one
          space before the <literal>value</literal>.  Lastly, be
          careful about spaces in your command-line to be invoked.  If
          a directory name contains spaces (or other characters that
          need escaping), place the entire inner value
          of <literal>binpath</literal> in double-quotes, by escaping
          them:</para>

        <screen>
C:\&gt; sc create svn
        binpath= "\"C:\program files\svn\bin\svnserve.exe\" --service [args]"
        displayname= "Subversion Server"
        depend= Tcpip
        start= auto
</screen>

        <para>Once the service is defined, it can stopped, started, or
          queried using standard GUI tools (The Services
          administrative control panel), or at the command line as
          well:</para>

        <screen>
C:\&gt; net stop svn
C:\&gt; net start svn
</screen>

        <para>The service can also be uninstalled (i.e. undefined) by
          deleting its definition:  <literal>sc delete svn</literal>.
          Just be sure to stop the service first!
          The <command>SC.EXE</command> program has many other

        authentication challenge.  In essence, the server sends a
        small amount of data to the client.  The client uses the MD5
        hash algorithm to create a fingerprint of the data and
        password combined, then sends the fingerprint as a response.
        The server performs the same computation with the stored
        password to verify that the result is identical.  <emphasis>At
        no point does the actual password travel over the
        network.</emphasis></para>

      <para>It's also possible, of course, for the client to be
        externally authenticated via a tunnel agent, such as
        <command>SSH</command>.  In that case, the server simply

      <para>As you've already guessed, a repository's

        mechanism for controlling authentication and authorization
        policies.  The file has the same format as other configuration

        are marked by square brackets (<literal>[</literal> and
        <literal>]</literal>), comments begin with hashes
        (<literal>#</literal>), and each section contains
        specific variables that can be set (<literal>variable =
        value</literal>).  Let's walk through this file and learn how
        to use them.</para>

      <sect3 id="svn.serverconfig.svnserve.auth.users">
        <title>Create a 'users' file and realm</title>

        <para>For now, the <literal>[general]</literal> section of the
          <filename>svnserve.conf</filename> has all the variables you
          need.  Begin by defining a file which contains usernames and
          passwords, and an authentication realm:</para>

        <screen>
[general]
password-db = userfile
realm = example realm
</screen>

        <para>The <literal>realm</literal> is a name that you define.
          It tells clients which sort of <quote>authentication
          namespace</quote> they're connecting to; the Subversion
          client displays it in the authentication prompt, and uses it
          as a key (along with the server's hostname and port) for
          caching credentials on disk (see <xref
          linkend="svn.serverconfig.netmodel.credcache"/>).  The
          <literal>password-db</literal> variable points to a separate
          file that contains a list of usernames and passwords, using
          the same familiar format.  For example:</para>

        <screen>
[users]
harry = foopassword
sally = barpassword
</screen>

        <para>The value of <literal>password-db</literal> can be an
          absolute or relative path to the users file.  For many
          admins, it's easy to keep the file right in the
          <filename>conf/</filename> area of the repository, alongside
          <filename>svnserve.conf</filename>.  On the other hand, it's
          possible you may want to have two or more repositories share
          the same users file; in that case, the file should probably
          live in a more public place.  The repositories sharing the
          users file should also be configured to have the same realm,
          since the list of users essentially defines an
          authentication realm.  Wherever the file lives, be sure to
          set the file's read and write permissions appropriately.  If
          you know which user(s) <command>svnserve</command> will run
          as, restrict read access to the user file as necessary.</para>

        <title>Set access controls</title>

        <para>There are two more variables to set in the
          <filename>svnserve.conf</filename> file: they determine what
          unauthenticated (anonymous) and authenticated users are
          allowed to do.  The variables <literal>anon-access</literal>
          and <literal>auth-access</literal> can be set to the values
          <literal>none</literal>, <literal>read</literal>, or
          <literal>write</literal>.  Setting the value to
          <literal>none</literal> restricts all access of any kind;
          <literal>read</literal> allows read-only access to the
          repository, and <literal>write</literal> allows complete
          read/write access to the repository.  For example:</para>

        <screen>
[general]
password-db = userfile
realm = example realm

# anonymous users can only read the repository
anon-access = read

# authenticated users can both read and write
auth-access = write

        <para>The example settings are, in fact, the default values of

[general]
password-db = userfile
realm = example realm

# anonymous users aren't allowed
anon-access = none

# authenticated users can both read and write

        <para>The server process not only understands

        repository, but also finer-grained access restrictions placed
        on specific files and directories within the repository.  To
        make use of this feature, you need to define a file containing
        more detailed rules, and then set
        the <literal>authz-db</literal> variable to point to it:</para>

        <screen>
[general]
password-db = userfile
realm = example realm

# Specific access rules for specific locations
authz-db = authzfile
</screen>

        <para>The syntax of the <filename>authzfile</filename> file is

          that the <literal>authz-db</literal> variable isn't mutually
          exclusive with the <literal>anon-access</literal>
          and <literal>auth-access</literal> variables;  if all the
          variables are defined at once, then <emphasis>all</emphasis>
          of the rules must be satisfied before access is allowed.</para>

      <title>SSH authentication and authorization</title>

      <para><command>svnserve</command>'s built-in authentication can
        be very handy, because it avoids the need to create real
        system accounts.  On the other hand, some administrators
        already have well-established SSH authentication frameworks in
        place.  In these situations, all of the project's users
        already have system accounts and the ability to <quote>SSH
        into</quote> the server machine.</para>

      <para>It's easy to use SSH in conjunction with
        <command>svnserve</command>.  The client simply uses the
        <literal>svn+ssh://</literal> URL schema to connect:</para>

      <screen>
$ whoami
harry

$ svn list svn+ssh://host.example.com/repos/project
harry@host.example.com's password:  *****

foo
bar
baz
&hellip;
</screen>

      <para>In this example, the Subversion client is invoking a local
        <command>ssh</command> process, connecting to
        <literal>host.example.com</literal>, authenticating as the
        user <literal>harry</literal>, then spawning a private
        <command>svnserve</command> process on the remote machine
        running as the user <literal>harry</literal>.  The
        <command>svnserve</command> command is being invoked in tunnel
        mode (<option>-t</option>) and its network protocol is being
        <quote>tunneled</quote> over the encrypted connection by
        <command>ssh</command>, the tunnel-agent.
        <command>svnserve</command> is aware that it's running as the
        user <literal>harry</literal>, and if the client performs a
        commit, the authenticated username will be attributed as the
        author of the new revision.</para>

      <para>The important thing to understand here is that the
        Subversion client is <emphasis>not</emphasis> connecting to a
        running <command>svnserve</command> daemon.  This method of
        access doesn't require a daemon, nor does it notice one if
        present.  It relies wholly on the ability of
        <command>ssh</command> to spawn a temporary
        <command>svnserve</command> process, which then terminates
        when the network connection is closed.</para>

      <para>When using <literal>svn+ssh://</literal> URLs to access a
        repository, remember that it's the <command>ssh</command>
        program prompting for authentication, and
        <emphasis>not</emphasis> the <command>svn</command> client
        program.  That means there's no automatic password caching
        going on (see <xref linkend="svn.serverconfig.netmodel.credcache"/>).  The
        Subversion client often makes multiple connections to the
        repository, though users don't normally notice this due to the
        password caching feature.  When using
        <literal>svn+ssh://</literal> URLs, however, users may be
        annoyed by <command>ssh</command> repeatedly asking for a
        password for every outbound connection.  The solution is to
        use a separate SSH password-caching tool like
        <command>ssh-agent</command> on a Unix-like system, or
        <command>pageant</command> on Windows.</para>

      <para>When running over a tunnel, authorization is primarily
        controlled by operating system permissions to the repository's
        database files; it's very much the same as if Harry were
        accessing the repository directly via a
        <literal>file:///</literal> URL.  If multiple system users are
        going to be accessing the repository directly, you may want to
        place them into a common group, and you'll need to be careful
        about umasks.  (Be sure to read <xref
        linkend="svn.serverconfig.multimethod"/>.)  But even in the case of
        tunneling, the <filename>svnserve.conf</filename> file can
        still be used to block access, by simply setting
        <literal>auth-access = read</literal> or <literal>auth-access
        = none</literal>.
        <footnote>
          <para>Note that using any sort
            of <command>svnserve</command>-enforced access control at
            all is a bit pointless;  the user already has direct access to
            the repository database.</para>
        </footnote>
      </para>

      <para>You'd think that the story of SSH tunneling would end
        here, but it doesn't.  Subversion allows you to create custom
        tunnel behaviors in your run-time <filename>config</filename>
        file (see <xref linkend="svn.advanced.confarea"/>).  For example,
        suppose you want to use RSH instead of SSH.  In the
        <literal>[tunnels]</literal> section of your
        <filename>config</filename> file, simply define it like
        this:</para>

      <screen>
[tunnels]
rsh = rsh
</screen>

      <para>And now, you can use this new tunnel definition by using a
        URL schema that matches the name of your new variable:
        <literal>svn+rsh://host/path</literal>.  When using the new
        URL schema, the Subversion client will actually be running the
        command <command>rsh host svnserve -t</command> behind the
        scenes.  If you include a username in the URL (for example,
        <literal>svn+rsh://username@host/path</literal>) the client
        will also include that in its command (<command>rsh
        username@host svnserve -t</command>).  But you can define new
        tunneling schemes to be much more clever than that:</para>

      <screen>
[tunnels]
joessh = $JOESSH /opt/alternate/ssh -p 29934
</screen>

      <para>This example demonstrates a couple of things.  First, it
        shows how to make the Subversion client launch a very specific
        tunneling binary (the one located at
        <filename>/opt/alternate/ssh</filename>) with specific
        options.  In this case, accessing a
        <literal>svn+joessh://</literal> URL would invoke the
        particular SSH binary with <option>-p 29934</option> as
        arguments&mdash;useful if you want the tunnel program to
        connect to a non-standard port.</para>

      <para>Second, it shows how to define a custom environment
        variable that can override the name of the tunneling program.
        Setting the <literal>SVN_SSH</literal> environment variable is
        a convenient way to override the default SSH tunnel agent.
        But if you need to have several different overrides for
        different servers, each perhaps contacting a different port or
        passing a different set of options to SSH, you can use the
        mechanism demonstrated in this example.  Now if we were to set
        the <literal>JOESSH</literal> environment variable, its value
        would override the entire value of the tunnel
        variable&mdash;<command>$JOESSH</command> would be executed
        instead of <command>/opt/alternate/ssh -p
        29934</command>.</para>

          Each line in this file describes a public key that is
          allowed to connect.  The lines are typically of the
          form:</para>

        <screen>
  ssh-dsa AAAABtce9euch&hellip; user@example.com
</screen>

        <para>The first field describes the type of key, the second
          field is the uuencoded key itself, and the third field is a
          comment.  However, it's a lesser known fact that the entire
          line can be preceded by a <literal>command</literal>
          field:</para>

        <screen>
  command="program" ssh-dsa AAAABtce9euch&hellip; user@example.com
</screen>

        <para>When the <literal>command</literal> field is set, the
          SSH daemon will run the named program instead of the
          typical <command>svnserve -t</command> invocation that the
          Subversion client asks for.  This opens the door to a number
          of server-side tricks.  In the following examples, we
          abbreviate the lines of the file as:</para>

        <screen>
  command="program" TYPE KEY COMMENT
</screen>

      </sect3>

      <!-- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -->
      <sect3 id="svn.serverconfig.svnserve.sshtricks.fixedcmd">
        <title>Controlling the invoked command</title>

        <para>Because we can specify the executed server-side command,
          it's easy to name a specific <command>svnserve</command>
          binary to run and to pass it extra arguments:</para>

        <screen>
  command="/path/to/svnserve -t -r /virtual/root" TYPE KEY COMMENT
</screen>

        <para>In this example, <filename>/path/to/svnserve</filename>
          might be a custom wrapper script
          around <command>svnserve</command> which sets the umask (see
          <xref linkend="svn.serverconfig.multimethod"/>).  It also shows how to
          anchor <command>svnserve</command> in a virtual root
          directory, just as one often does when
          running <command>svnserve</command> as a daemon process.
          This might be done either to restrict access to parts of the
          system, or simply to relieve the user of having to type an
          absolute path in the <literal>svn+ssh://</literal>
          URL.</para>

        <para>It's also possible to have multiple users share a single
          account.  Instead of creating a separate system account for
          each user, generate a public/private keypair for each
          person.  Then place each public key into
          the <filename>authorized_users</filename> file, one per
          line, and use the <option>--tunnel-user</option>
          option:</para>

        <screen>
  command="svnserve -t --tunnel-user=harry" TYPE1 KEY1 harry@example.com
  command="svnserve -t --tunnel-user=sally" TYPE2 KEY2 sally@example.com
</screen>

        <para>This example allows both Harry and Sally to connect to
          the same account via public-key authentication.  Each of
          them has a custom command that will be executed;
          the <option>--tunnel-user</option> option 
          tells <command>svnserve -t</command> to assume that the named
          argument is the authenticated user.  Without
          <option>--tunnel-user</option>, it would appear as though
          all commits were coming from the one shared system
          account.</para>

        <para>A final word of caution: giving a user access to the
          server via public-key in a shared account might still allow
          other forms of SSH access, even if you've set
          the <literal>command</literal> value
          in <filename>authorized_keys</filename>.  For example, the
          user may still get shell access through SSH, or be able to
          perform X11 or general port-forwarding through your server.
          To give the user as little permission as possible, you may
          want to specify a number of restrictive options immediately
          after the <literal>command</literal>:</para>

        <screen>
  command="svnserve -t --tunnel-user=harry",no-port-forwarding,\
           no-agent-forwarding,no-X11-forwarding,no-pty \

    <title>httpd, the Apache HTTP server</title>

    <para>The Apache HTTP Server is a <quote>heavy duty</quote>
      network server that Subversion can leverage.  Via a custom
      module, <command>httpd</command> makes Subversion repositories
      available to clients via the WebDAV/DeltaV protocol, which is an
      extension to HTTP 1.1 (see <ulink url="http://www.webdav.org/"/>
      for more information).  This protocol takes the ubiquitous HTTP
      protocol that is the core of the World Wide Web, and adds
      writing&mdash;specifically, versioned
      writing&mdash;capabilities.  The result is a standardized,
      robust system that is conveniently packaged as part of the
      Apache 2.0 software, is supported by numerous operating systems
      and third-party products, and doesn't require network
      administrators to open up yet another custom port.
      <footnote>
        <para>They really hate doing that.</para>
      </footnote>
      While an Apache-Subversion server has more features than
      <command>svnserve</command>, it's also a bit more difficult
      to set up.  With flexibility often comes more complexity.</para>

    <para>Much of the following discussion includes references to
      Apache configuration directives.  While some examples are given
      of the use of these directives, describing them in full is
      outside the scope of this chapter.  The Apache team maintains
      excellent documentation, publicly available on their website at
      <ulink url="http://httpd.apache.org"/>.  For example, a general
      reference for the configuration directives is located at <ulink url="
      http://httpd.apache.org/docs-2.0/mod/directives.html"/>.</para>

    <para>Also, as you make changes to your Apache setup, it is likely
      that somewhere along the way a mistake will be made.  If you are
      not already familiar with Apache's logging subsystem, you should
      become aware of it.  In your <filename>httpd.conf</filename>
      file are directives that specify the on-disk locations of the
      access and error logs generated by Apache (the
      <literal>CustomLog</literal> and <literal>ErrorLog</literal>
      directives, respectively).  Subversion's mod_dav_svn uses
      Apache's error logging interface as well.  You can always browse
      the contents of those files for information that might reveal
      the source of a problem that is not clearly noticeable
      otherwise.</para>

      <title>Why Apache 2?</title>

      <para>If you're a system administrator, it's very likely that
        you're already running the Apache web server and have some
        prior experience with it.  At the time of writing, Apache 1.3
        is by far the most popular version of Apache.  The world has
        been somewhat slow to upgrade to the Apache 2.X series for
        various reasons: some people fear change, especially changing
        something as critical as a web server.  Other people depend on
        plug-in modules that only work against the Apache 1.3 API, and
        are waiting for a 2.X port.  Whatever the reason, many people
        begin to worry when they first discover that Subversion's
        Apache module is written specifically for the Apache 2 API.</para>

      <para>The proper response to this problem is: don't worry about
        it.  It's easy to run Apache 1.3 and Apache 2 side-by-side;
        simply install them to separate places, and use Apache 2 as a
        dedicated Subversion server that runs on a port other than 80.
        Clients can access the repository by placing the port number
        into the URL:</para>

      <title>Prerequisites</title>

      <para>To network your repository over HTTP, you basically need
        four components, available in two packages.  You'll need
        Apache <command>httpd</command> 2.0, the
        <command>mod_dav</command> DAV module that comes with it,
        Subversion, and the <command>mod_dav_svn</command>
        filesystem provider module distributed with Subversion.
        Once you have all of those components, the process of
        networking your repository is as simple as:</para>

      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>

            module,</para>

        <listitem>
          <para>installing the mod_dav_svn plugin to mod_dav, which

            file to export (or expose) the repository.</para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>

      <para>You can accomplish the first two items either by
        compiling <command>httpd</command> and Subversion from
        source code, or by installing pre-built binary packages of
        them on your system.  For the most up-to-date information on
        how to compile Subversion for use with the Apache HTTP Server,
        as well as how to compile and configure Apache itself for
        this purpose, see the <filename>INSTALL</filename> file in
        the top level of the Subversion source code tree.</para>

    </sect2>

    <!-- =============================================================== -->
    <sect2 id="svn.serverconfig.httpd.basic">
      <title>Basic Apache Configuration</title>

      <para>Once you have all the necessary components installed on
        your system, all that remains is the configuration of Apache
        via its <filename>httpd.conf</filename> file.  Instruct Apache
        to load the mod_dav_svn module using the
        <literal>LoadModule</literal> directive.  This directive must
        precede any other Subversion-related configuration items.  If
        your Apache was installed using the default layout, your
        <command>mod_dav_svn</command> module should have been
        installed in the <filename>modules</filename> subdirectory of
        the Apache install location (often
        <filename>/usr/local/apache2</filename>).  The
        <literal>LoadModule</literal> directive has a simple syntax,
        mapping a named module to the location of a shared library on
        disk:</para>

        <screen>
LoadModule dav_svn_module     modules/mod_dav_svn.so
</screen>

      <para>Note that if <command>mod_dav</command> was compiled as a
        shared object (instead of statically linked directly to the
        <command>httpd</command> binary), you'll need a similar
        <literal>LoadModule</literal> statement for it, too.  Be sure
        that it comes before the <command>mod_dav_svn</command> line:</para>

        <screen>
LoadModule dav_module         modules/mod_dav.so
LoadModule dav_svn_module     modules/mod_dav_svn.so
</screen>


      <para>At a later location in your configuration file, you now
        need to tell Apache where you keep your Subversion repository
        (or repositories).  The <literal>Location</literal> directive
        has an XML-like notation, starting with an opening tag, and
        ending with a closing tag, with various other configuration
        directives in the middle.  The purpose of the
        <literal>Location</literal> directive is to instruct Apache to
        do something special when handling requests that are directed
        at a given URL or one of its children.  In the case of
        Subversion, you want Apache to simply hand off support for
        URLs that point at versioned resources to the DAV layer.  You
        can instruct Apache to delegate the handling of all URLs whose
        path portions (the part of the URL that follows the server's
        name and the optional port number) begin with
        <filename>/repos/</filename> to a DAV provider whose
        repository is located at
        <filename>/absolute/path/to/repository</filename> using the
        following <filename>httpd.conf</filename> syntax:</para>

        <screen>
&lt;Location /repos&gt;
  DAV svn
  SVNPath /absolute/path/to/repository
&lt;/Location&gt;
</screen>

      <para>If you plan to support multiple Subversion repositories
        that will reside in the same parent directory on your local
        disk, you can use an alternative directive, the
        <literal>SVNParentPath</literal> directive, to indicate that
        common parent directory.  For example, if you know you will be
        creating multiple Subversion repositories in a directory
        <filename>/usr/local/svn</filename> that would be accessed via
        URLs like <uri>http://my.server.com/svn/repos1</uri>,
        <uri>http://my.server.com/svn/repos2</uri>, and
        so on, you could use the <filename>httpd.conf</filename>
        configuration syntax in the following example:</para>

        <screen>
&lt;Location /svn&gt;
  DAV svn

  # any "/svn/foo" URL will map to a repository /usr/local/svn/foo
  SVNParentPath /usr/local/svn
&lt;/Location&gt;
</screen>

      <para>Using the previous syntax, Apache will delegate the
        handling of all URLs whose path portions begin with
        <filename>/svn/</filename> to the Subversion DAV provider,
        which will then assume that any items in the directory
        specified by the <literal>SVNParentPath</literal> directive
        are actually Subversion repositories.  This is a particularly
        convenient syntax in that, unlike the use of the
        <literal>SVNPath</literal> directive, you don't have to
        restart Apache in order to create and network new
        repositories.</para>

      <para>Be sure that when you define your new
        <literal>Location</literal>, it doesn't overlap with other
        exported Locations.  For example, if your main
        <literal>DocumentRoot</literal> is exported to
        <filename>/www</filename>, do not export a Subversion
        repository in <literal>&lt;Location /www/repos&gt;</literal>.
        If a request comes in for the URI
        <filename>/www/repos/foo.c</filename>, Apache won't know
        whether to look for a file <filename>repos/foo.c</filename> in
        the <literal>DocumentRoot</literal>, or whether to delegate
        <command>mod_dav_svn</command> to return
        <filename>foo.c</filename> from the Subversion
        repository.</para>

      <sidebar>
        <title>Server Names and the COPY Request</title>

        <para>Subversion makes use of the <literal>COPY</literal>
          request type to perform server-side copies of files and
          directories.  As part of the sanity checking done by the
          Apache modules, the source of the copy is expected to be
          located on the same machine as the destination of the copy.
          To satisfy this requirement, you might need to tell mod_dav
          the name you use as the hostname of your server.  Generally,
          you can use the <literal>ServerName</literal> directive in
          <filename>httpd.conf</filename> to accomplish this.</para>

        <screen>
ServerName svn.example.com
</screen>

        <para>If you are using Apache's virtual hosting support via
          the <literal>NameVirtualHost</literal> directive, you may
          need to use the <literal>ServerAlias</literal> directive to
          specify additional names that your server is known by.
          Again, refer to the Apache documentation for full
          details.</para>
      </sidebar>

      <para>At this stage, you should strongly consider the question
        of permissions.  If you've been running Apache for some time
        now as your regular web server, you probably already have a
        collection of content&mdash;web pages, scripts and such.
        These items have already been configured with a set of
        permissions that allows them to work with Apache, or more
        appropriately, that allows Apache to work with those files.
        Apache, when used as a Subversion server, will also need the
        correct permissions to read and write to your Subversion
        repository.</para>

      <para>You will need to determine a permission system setup that
        satisfies Subversion's requirements without messing up any
        previously existing web page or script installations.  This
        might mean changing the permissions on your Subversion
        repository to match those in use by other things that Apache
        serves for you, or it could mean using the
        <literal>User</literal> and <literal>Group</literal>
        directives in <filename>httpd.conf</filename> to specify that
        Apache should run as the user and group that owns your
        Subversion repository.  There is no single correct way to set
        up your permissions, and each administrator will have
        different reasons for doing things a certain way.  Just be
        aware that permission-related problems are perhaps the most
        common oversight when configuring a Subversion repository for
        use with Apache.</para>

        <title>Basic HTTP Authentication</title>

        <para>The easiest way to authenticate a client is via the
          HTTP Basic authentication mechanism, which simply uses a
          username and password to verify that a user is who she says
          she is.  Apache provides an <command>htpasswd</command>
          utility for managing the list of acceptable usernames and
          passwords, those to whom you wish to grant special access to
          your Subversion repository.  Let's grant commit access to
          Sally and Harry.  First, we need to add them to the password
          file.</para>

        <screen>

        <para>Next, you need to add some more
          <filename>httpd.conf</filename> directives inside your
          <literal>Location</literal> block to tell Apache what to do
          with your new password file.  The
          <literal>AuthType</literal> directive specifies the type of
          authentication system to use.  In this case, we want to
          specify the <literal>Basic</literal> authentication system.
          <literal>AuthName</literal> is an arbitrary name that you
          give for the authentication domain.  Most browsers will
          display this name in the pop-up dialog box when the browser
          is querying the user for his name and password.  Finally,
          use the <literal>AuthUserFile</literal> directive to specify
          the location of the password file you created using
          <command>htpasswd</command>.</para>

        <para>After adding these three directives, your
          <literal>&lt;Location&gt;</literal> block should look
          something like this:</para>

        <screen>
&lt;Location /svn&gt;
  DAV svn
  SVNParentPath /usr/local/svn
  AuthType Basic
  AuthName "Subversion repository"
  AuthUserFile /etc/svn-auth-file
&lt;/Location&gt;
</screen>

        <para>This <literal>&lt;Location&gt;</literal> block is not
          yet complete, and will not do anything useful.  It's merely
          telling Apache that whenever authorization is required,
          Apache should harvest a username and password from the
          Subversion client.  What's missing here, however, are
          directives that tell Apache <emphasis>which</emphasis> sorts
          of client requests require authorization.  Wherever
          authorization is required, Apache will demand
          authentication as well.  The simplest thing to do is protect
          all requests.  Adding <literal>Require valid-user</literal>
          tells Apache that all requests require an authenticated
          user:</para>

        <screen>
&lt;Location /svn&gt;
  DAV svn
  SVNParentPath /usr/local/svn
  AuthType Basic
  AuthName "Subversion repository"
  AuthUserFile /etc/svn-auth-file

        <para>One word of warning: HTTP Basic Auth passwords pass in
          very nearly plain-text over the network, and thus are
          extremely insecure.  If you're worried about password
          snooping, it may be best to use some sort of SSL encryption,
          so that clients authenticate via <literal>https://</literal>
          instead of <literal>http://</literal>; at a bare minimum,
          you can configure Apache to use a self-signed server
          certificate.
          <footnote>
            <para>While self-signed server certificates are still
              vulnerable to a <quote>man in the middle</quote> attack,
              such an attack is still much more difficult for a casual
              observer to pull off, compared to sniffing unprotected
              passwords.</para>

        <title>SSL Certificate Management</title>

        <para>Businesses that need to expose their repositories for access
          outside the company firewall should be conscious of the
          possibility that unauthorized parties could be
          <quote>sniffing</quote> their network traffic.  SSL makes

        <para>If a Subversion client is compiled to use OpenSSL, then
          it gains the ability to speak to an Apache server via
          <literal>https://</literal> URLs.  The Neon library used by
          the Subversion client is not only able to verify server
          certificates, but can also supply client certificates when
          challenged.  When the client and server have exchanged SSL
          certificates and successfully authenticated one another, all
          further communication is encrypted via a session key.</para>

        <para>It's beyond the scope of this book to describe how to
          generate client and server certificates, and how to
          configure Apache to use them.  Many other books, including
          Apache's own documentation, describe this task.  But what
          <emphasis>can</emphasis> be covered here is how to manage
          server and client certificates from an ordinary Subversion
          client.</para>

        <para>When speaking to Apache via <literal>https://</literal>,
          a Subversion client can receive two different types of
          information:</para>

        <itemizedlist>
          <listitem><para>a server certificate</para></listitem>
          <listitem><para>a demand for a client certificate</para></listitem>
        </itemizedlist>

        <para>If the client receives a server certificate, it needs to
          verify that it trusts the certificate: is the server really
          who it claims to be?  The OpenSSL library does this by
          examining the signer of the server certificate, or
          <firstterm>certifying authority</firstterm> (CA).  If
          OpenSSL is unable to automatically trust the CA, or if some
          other problem occurs (such as an expired certificate or
          hostname mismatch), the Subversion command-line client will
          ask you whether you want to trust the server certificate
          anyway:</para>

        <screen>

   fingerprint to validate the certificate manually!

(R)eject, accept (t)emporarily or accept (p)ermanently?
</screen>

        <para>This dialogue should look familiar; it's essentially the
          same question you've probably seen coming from your web
          browser (which is just another HTTP client like Subversion!).
          If you choose the (p)ermanent option, the server certificate
          will be cached in your private run-time
          <filename>auth/</filename> area in just the same way your
          username and password are cached (see <xref
          linkend="svn.serverconfig.netmodel.credcache"/>).  If cached,
          Subversion will automatically remember to trust this certificate
          in future negotiations.</para>

        <para>Your run-time <filename>servers</filename> file also gives
          you the ability to make your Subversion client automatically
          trust specific CAs, either globally or on a per-host basis.
          Simply set the <literal>ssl-authority-files</literal>
          variable to a semicolon-separated list of PEM-encoded CA
          certificates:</para>

        <screen>
[global]
ssl-authority-files = /path/to/CAcert1.pem;/path/to/CAcert2.pem
</screen>

        <para>Many OpenSSL installations also have a pre-defined set
          of <quote>default</quote> CAs that are nearly universally
          trusted.  To make the Subversion client automatically trust
          these standard authorities, set the
          <literal>ssl-trust-default-ca</literal> variable to
          <literal>true</literal>.</para>

        <para>When talking to Apache, a Subversion client might also
          receive a challenge for a client certificate.  Apache is
          asking the client to identify itself: is the client really
          who it says it is?  If all goes correctly, the Subversion
          client sends back a private certificate signed by a CA that
          Apache trusts.  A client certificate is usually stored on
          disk in encrypted format, protected by a local password.
          When Subversion receives this challenge, it will ask you for
          both a path to the certificate and the password which
          protects it:</para>

        <screen>
$ svn list https://host.example.com/repos/project

Authentication realm: https://host.example.com:443
Client certificate filename: /path/to/my/cert.p12
Passphrase for '/path/to/my/cert.p12':  ********
&hellip;
</screen>

        <para>Notice that the client certificate is a
          <quote>p12</quote> file.  To use a client certificate with
          Subversion, it must be in PKCS#12 format, which is a
          portable standard.  Most web browsers are already able to
          import and export certificates in that format.   Another
          option is to use the OpenSSL command-line tools to convert
          existing certificates into PKCS#12.</para>

        <para>Again, the runtime <filename>servers</filename> file
          allows you to automate this challenge on a per-host basis.
          Either or both pieces of information can be described in
          runtime variables:</para>

        <screen>
[groups]
examplehost = host.example.com

[examplehost]
ssl-client-cert-file = /path/to/my/cert.p12
ssl-client-cert-password = somepassword
</screen>

        <para>Once you've set the
          <literal>ssl-client-cert-file</literal> and
          <literal>ssl-client-cert-password</literal> variables, the
          Subversion client can automatically respond to a client
          certificate challenge without prompting you.
          <footnote>
            <para>More security-conscious folk might not want to store
              the client certificate password in the runtime
              <filename>servers</filename> file.</para>

      <title>Authorization Options</title>

      <para>At this point, you've configured authentication, but not
        authorization.  Apache is able to challenge clients and
        confirm identities, but it has not been told how to allow or
        restrict access to the clients bearing those identities.  This
        section describes two strategies for controlling access to
        your repositories.</para>

      <sect3 id="svn.serverconfig.httpd.authz.blanket">
        <title>Blanket Access Control</title>

        <para>The simplest form of access control is to authorize
          certain users for either read-only access to a repository,
          or read/write access to a repository.</para>

        <para>You can restrict access on all repository operations by
          adding the <literal>Require valid-user</literal> directive
          to your <literal>&lt;Location&gt;</literal> block.  Using
          our previous example, this would mean that only clients that
          claimed to be either <literal>harry</literal> or
          <literal>sally</literal>, and provided the correct
          password for their respective username, would be allowed to
          do anything with the Subversion repository:</para>

        <screen>
&lt;Location /svn&gt;
  DAV svn
  SVNParentPath /usr/local/svn

  # how to authenticate a user
  AuthType Basic
  AuthName "Subversion repository"
  AuthUserFile /path/to/users/file

  # only authenticated users may access the repository
  Require valid-user
&lt;/Location&gt;
</screen>

        <para>Sometimes you don't need to run such a tight ship.  For
          example, Subversion's own source code repository at
          <ulink url="http://svn.collab.net/repos/svn"/> allows anyone
          in the world to perform read-only repository tasks (like
          checking out working copies and browsing the repository with
          a web browser), but restricts all write operations to
          authenticated users.  To do this type of selective
          restriction, you can use the <literal>Limit</literal> and
          <literal>LimitExcept</literal> configuration directives.
          Like the <literal>Location</literal> directive, these blocks
          have starting and ending tags, and you would nest them
          inside your <literal>&lt;Location&gt;</literal>
          block.</para>

        <para>The parameters present on the <literal>Limit</literal>
          and <literal>LimitExcept</literal> directives are HTTP
          request types that are affected by that block.  For example,
          if you wanted to disallow all access to your repository
          except the currently supported read-only operations, you
          would use the <literal>LimitExcept</literal> directive,
          passing the <literal>GET</literal>,
          <literal>PROPFIND</literal>, <literal>OPTIONS</literal>, and
          <literal>REPORT</literal> request type parameters.  Then the
          previously mentioned <literal>Require valid-user</literal>
          directive would be placed inside the
          <literal>&lt;LimitExcept&gt;</literal> block instead of just
          inside the <literal>&lt;Location&gt;</literal> block.</para>

        <screen>

        <para>These are only a few simple examples.  For more in-depth

        <para>It's possible to set up finer-grained permissions using
          a second Apache httpd module,
          <command>mod_authz_svn</command>.  This module grabs the
          various opaque URLs passing from client to server, asks
          <command>mod_dav_svn</command> to decode them, and then
          possibly vetoes requests based on access policies defined in
          a configuration file.</para>

        <para>If you've built Subversion from source code,
          <command>mod_authz_svn</command> is automatically built
          and installed alongside <command>mod_dav_svn</command>.
          Many binary distributions install it automatically as well.
          To verify that it's installed correctly, make sure it comes
          right after <command>mod_dav_svn</command>'s
          <literal>LoadModule</literal> directive in
          <filename>httpd.conf</filename>:</para>

LoadModule dav_svn_module     modules/mod_dav_svn.so
LoadModule authz_svn_module   modules/mod_authz_svn.so
</screen>

        <para>To activate this module, you need to configure your
          <literal>Location</literal> block to use the
          <literal>AuthzSVNAccessFile</literal> directive, which
          specifies a file containing the permissions policy for paths
          within your repositories.  (In a moment, we'll discuss the
          format of that file.)</para>

        <para>Apache is flexible, so you have the option to configure
          your block in one of three general patterns.  To begin,
          choose one of these basic configuration patterns.  (The
          examples below are very simple; look at Apache's own
          documentation for much more detail on Apache authentication
          and authorization options.)</para>

        <para>The simplest block is to allow open access to everyone.
          In this scenario, Apache never sends authentication
          challenges, so all users are treated as
          <quote>anonymous</quote>.</para>

        <example id="svn.serverconfig.httpd.authz.perdir.ex-1">
          <title>A sample configuration for anonymous access.</title>
          <programlisting>
&lt;Location /repos&gt;
  DAV svn
  SVNParentPath /usr/local/svn

  # our access control policy
  AuthzSVNAccessFile /path/to/access/file
&lt;/Location&gt;
          </programlisting>
        </example>

        <para>On the opposite end of the paranoia scale, you can
          configure your block to demand authentication from everyone.
          All clients must supply credentials to identify themselves.
          Your block unconditionally requires authentication via the
          <literal>Require valid-user</literal> directive, and defines
          a means to authenticate.</para>

        <example id="svn.serverconfig.httpd.authz.perdir.ex-2">
          <title>A sample configuration for authenticated access.</title>
          <programlisting>

  SVNParentPath /usr/local/svn

  # our access control policy
  AuthzSVNAccessFile /path/to/access/file

  # only authenticated users may access the repository
  Require valid-user

  # how to authenticate a user
  AuthType Basic
  AuthName "Subversion repository"
  AuthUserFile /path/to/users/file
&lt;/Location&gt;
          </programlisting>
        </example>

        <para>A third very popular pattern is to allow a combination
          of authenticated and anonymous access.  For example, many
          administrators want to allow anonymous users to read certain
          repository directories, but want only authenticated users to
          read (or write) more sensitive areas.  In this setup, all
          users start out accessing the repository anonymously.  If
          your access control policy demands a real username at any
          point, Apache will demand authentication from the client.
          To do this, you use both the <literal>Satisfy Any</literal>
          and <literal>Require valid-user</literal> directives
          together.</para>

        <example id="svn.serverconfig.httpd.authz.perdir.ex-3">
          <title>A sample configuration for mixed
            authenticated/anonymous access.</title>

  # try anonymous access first, resort to real
  # authentication if necessary.
  Satisfy Any
  Require valid-user

  # how to authenticate a user
  AuthType Basic
  AuthName "Subversion repository"
  AuthUserFile /path/to/users/file
&lt;/Location&gt;
          </programlisting>
        </example>

        <para>Once you've settled on one of these three
          basic <filename>httpd.conf</filename> templates, you need to
          create your file containing access rules for particular
          paths within the repository.  This is described in
          <xref linkend="svn.serverconfig.pathbasedauthz"/>.</para>

      <sect3 id="svn.serverconfig.httpd.authz.pathauthzoff">
        <title>Disabling Path-based Checks</title>

        <para>The <command>mod_dav_svn</command> module goes through a
          lot of work to make sure that data you've marked
          <quote>unreadable</quote> doesn't get accidentally leaked.
          This means that it needs to closely monitor all of the paths
          and file-contents returned by commands like <command>svn
          checkout</command> or <command>svn update</command>
          commands.  If these commands encounter a path that isn't
          readable according to some authorization policy, then the
          path is typically omitted altogether.  In the case of
          history or rename tracing&mdash;e.g. running a command like
          <command>svn cat -r OLD foo.c</command> on a file that was
          renamed long ago&mdash;the rename tracking will simply halt
          if one of the object's former names is determined to be
          read-restricted.</para>

        <para>All of this path-checking can sometimes be quite
          expensive, especially in the case of <command>svn
          log</command>.  When retrieving a list of revisions, the server
          looks at every changed path in each revision and checks it
          for readability.  If an unreadable path is discovered, then
          it's omitted from the list of the revision's changed paths
          (normally seen with the <option>--verbose</option> option),
          and the whole log message is suppressed.  Needless to say,
          this can be time-consuming on revisions that affect a large
          number of files.  This is the cost of security: even if you
          haven't configured a module like
          <command>mod_authz_svn</command> at all, the
          <command>mod_dav_svn</command> module is still asking Apache
          <command>httpd</command> to run authorization checks on
          every path.  The <command>mod_dav_svn</command> module has
          no idea what authorization modules have been installed, so
          all it can do is ask Apache to invoke whatever might be
          present.</para>

        <para>On the other hand, there's also an escape-hatch of
          sorts, one which allows you to trade security features for
          speed.  If you're not enforcing any sort of per-directory
          authorization (i.e. not using
          <command>mod_authz_svn</command> or similar module), then
          you can disable all of this path-checking.  In your
          <filename>httpd.conf</filename> file, use the
          <literal>SVNPathAuthz</literal> directive:</para>

          can be typed directly into a Web browser.  Your browser will
          issue an HTTP <literal>GET</literal> request for that URL, and
          based on whether that URL represents a versioned directory
          or file, mod_dav_svn will respond with a directory listing
          or with file contents.</para>

        <para>Since the URLs do not contain any information about
          which version of the resource you wish to see, mod_dav_svn
          will always answer with the youngest version.  This
          functionality has the wonderful side-effect that you can
          pass around Subversion URLs to your peers as references to
          documents, and those URLs will always point at the latest
          manifestation of that document.  Of course, you can even use
          the URLs as hyperlinks from other web sites, too.</para>

        <sidebar>
          <title>Can I view older revisions?</title>

          <para>With an ordinary web browser?  In one word: nope.  At
            least, not with <command>mod_dav_svn</command> as your
            only tool.</para>

          <para>Your web browser only speaks ordinary HTTP.  That
            means it only knows how to GET public URLs, which
            represent the latest versions of files and directories.
            According to the WebDAV/DeltaV specification, each server
            defines a private URL syntax for older versions of
            resources, and that syntax is opaque to clients.  To find
            an older version of a file, a client must follow a
            specific procedure to <quote>discover</quote> the proper
            URL; the procedure involves issuing a series of WebDAV
            PROPFIND requests and understanding DeltaV concepts.  This
            is something your web browser simply can't do.</para>

          <para>So to answer the question, one obvious way to see
            older revisions of files and directories is by passing the
            <option>--revision</option> argument to the <command>svn
            list</command> and <command>svn cat</command> commands.
            To browse old revisions with your web browser, however,
            you can use third-party software.  A good example of this
            is ViewVC (<ulink url="http://viewvc.tigris.org/"/>).
            ViewVC was originally written to display CVS repositories
            through the web,
            <footnote>
              <para>Back then, it was called <quote>ViewCVS</quote>.</para>
            </footnote>
            and the latest releases are able to understand Subversion
            repositories as well.</para>
        </sidebar>

        <sect4 id="svn.serverconfig.httpd.extra.browsing.mimetype">
          <title>Proper MIME Type</title>

          <para>When browsing a Subversion repository, the web browser
            gets a clue about how to render a file's contents by
            looking at the <literal>Content-Type:</literal> header
            returned in Apache's response to the
            HTTP <literal>GET</literal> request.  The value of this
            header is some sort of MIME type.  By default, Apache will
            tell the web browsers that all repository files are of
            the <quote>default</quote> MIME type,
            typically <literal>text/plain</literal>.  This can be
            frustrating, however, if a user wishes repository files to
            render as something more meaningful &mdash; for example,
            it might be nice to have a <filename>foo.html</filename> file
            in the repository actually render as HTML when
            browsing.</para>

          <para>To make this happen, you only need to make sure that
            your files have the
            proper <literal>svn:mime-type</literal> set.  This is
            discussed in more detail in
            <xref linkend="svn.advanced.props.special.mime-type"/>,
            and you can even configure your client to automatically
            attach proper <literal>svn:mime-type</literal> properties
            to files entering the repository for the first time;  see
            <xref linkend="svn.advanced.props.auto"/>.</para>

          <para>So in our example, if one were to set
          the <literal>svn:mime-type</literal> property
          to <literal>text/html</literal> on
          file <filename>foo.html</filename>, then Apache would
          properly tell your web browser to render the file as
          HTML.  One could also attach
          proper <literal>image/*</literal> mime-type properties to
          images, and by doing this, ultimately get an entire web
          site to be viewable directly from a repository!  There's
          generalyl no problem with doing this, as long as the
          website doesn't contain any dynamically-generated
          content.</para>

          <para>You generally will get more use out of URLs to

            occasion to browse a Subversion directory listing, where
            you'll quickly note that the generated HTML used to

            intended to be aesthetically pleasing (or even

            <filename>httpd.conf</filename> will instruct mod_dav_svn

        <title>Apache Logging</title>

        <para>Because Apache is an HTTP server at heart, it contains
          fantastically flexible logging feature.  It's beyond the
          scope of this book to discuss all ways logging can be
          configured, but we should point out that even the most
          generic <filename>httpd.conf</filename> file will cause
          Apache to produce two logs:
          <filename>error_log</filename>
          and <filename>access_log</filename>.  These logs may appear
          in different places, but are typically created in the
          logging area of your Apache installation.  (On Unix, they
          often live
          in <filename>/usr/local/apache2/logs/</filename>.)</para>

        <para>The <filename>error_log</filename> describes any interal
          errors that Apache runs into as it works.
          The <filename>access_log</filename> file records every
          incoming HTTP request received by Apache.  This makes it
          easy to see, for example, which IP addresses Subversion
          clients are coming from, how often particular clients use
          the server, which users are authenticating properly, and
          which requests succeed or fail.</para>

        <para>Unfortunately, because HTTP is a stateless protocol,
          even the simplest Subversion client operation generates
          multiple network requests.  It's very difficult to look at
          the <filename>access_log</filename> and deduce what the
          client was doing &mdash; most operations look like a series
          of cryptic <literal>PROPPATCH</literal>, <literal>GET</literal>,
          <literal>PUT</literal>, and <literal>REPORT</literal>
          requests.  To make things worse, many client operations send
          nearly-identical series of requests, so it's even harder to
          tell them apart.</para>

        <para><literal>mod_dav_svn</literal>, however, can come to
          your aid.  By activating an <quote>operational
          logging</quote> feature, you can
          ask <literal>mod_dav_svn</literal> to create a separate log
          file describing what sort of high-level operations your
          clients are performing.</para>

        <para>To do this, you need to make use of
          Apache's <literal>CustomLog</literal> directive (which is
          explained in more detail in Apache's own documentation).
          Be sure to invoke this
          directive <emphasis>outside</emphasis> of your
          Subversion <literal>Location</literal> block:</para>

&lt;/Location&gt;

CustomLog logs/svn_logfile "%t %u %{SVN-ACTION}e" env=SVN-ACTION
</screen>

        <para>In this example, we're asking Apache to create a special
          logfile <filename>svn_logfile</filename> in the standard
          Apache <filename>logs</filename> directory.
          The <literal>%t</literal> and <literal>%u</literal>
          variables are replaced by the time and username of the
          request, respectively.  The really important part are the
          two instances of <literal>SVN-ACTION</literal>.
          When Apache sees that variable, it substitutes the value of
          the <literal>SVN-ACTION</literal> environment variable,
          which is automatically set by <literal>mod_dav_svn</literal>
          whenever it detects a high-level client action.</para>

        <para>So instead of having to interpret a

        <title>Other Features</title>

        <para>Several of the features already provided by Apache in
          its role as a robust Web server can be leveraged for
          increased functionality or security in Subversion as well.
          Subversion communicates with Apache using Neon, which is a
          generic HTTP/WebDAV library with support for such mechanisms
          as SSL (the Secure Socket Layer, discussed earlier).  If
          your Subversion client is built to support SSL, then it can
          access your Apache server
          using <literal>https://</literal>.</para>

        <para>Equally useful are other features of the Apache and
          Subversion relationship, such as the ability to specify a
          custom port (instead of the default HTTP port 80) or a
          virtual domain name by which the Subversion repository
          should be accessed, or the ability to access the repository
          through an HTTP proxy.  These things are all supported by
          Neon, so Subversion gets that support for free.</para>

        <para>Finally, because <command>mod_dav_svn</command> is
          speaking a subset of the WebDAV/DeltaV protocol, it's
          possible to access the repository via third-party DAV
          clients.  Most modern operating systems (Win32, OS X, and
          Linux) have the built-in ability to mount a DAV server as a
          standard network share.  This is a complicated topic; for
          details, read <xref linkend="svn.webdav"/>.</para>

    <title>Path-Based Authorization</title>

    <para>Both Apache and <command>svnserve</command> are capable of
      granting (or denying) permissions to users.  Typically this is
      done over the entire repository: a user can read the repository
      (or not), and she can write to the repository (or not).  It's
      also possible, however, to define finer-grained access rules.
      One set of users may have permssion to write to a certain
      directory in the repository, but not others; another directory
      might not even be readable by all but a few special
      people.</para>

    <para>Both servers use a common file format to describe these
      path-based access rules.  In the case of Apache, one needs to
      load the <command>mod_authz_svn</command> module and then add
      the <literal>AuthzSVNAccessFile</literal> directive (within
      the <filename>httpd.conf</filename> file) pointing to your own
      rules-file.  (For a full explanation, see
      <xref linkend="svn.serverconfig.httpd.authz.perdir"/>.)  If
      you're using <command>svnserve</command>, then you need to make
      the <literal>authz-db</literal> variable
      (within <filename>svnserve.conf</filename>) point to your
      rules-file.</para>

    <sidebar>
      <title>Best practice: do you really need path-based access
        control?</title>

      <para>A lot of administrators setting up Subversion for the
        first time tend to jump into path-based access control without
        giving it a lot of thought.  The administrator usually knows
        which teams of people are working on which projects, so it's
        easy to jump in and grant certain teams access to certain
        directories and not others.  It seems like a natural thing,
        and it appeases the administrator's desire to maintain tight
        control of the repository.</para>

      <para>Note, though, that there are often invisible (and
        visible!) costs associated with this feature.  In the visible
        category, the server needs to do a lot more work to ensure
        that the user has the right to read or write each specific
        path; in certain situations, there's very noticeable
        performance loss.  In the invisible category, consider the
        culture you're creating.  Most of the time, while certain
        users <emphasis>shouldn't</emphasis> be committing changes to
        certain parts of the repository, that social contract doesn't
        need to be technologically enforced.  Teams can sometimes
        spontaneously collaborate with each other; someone may want to
        help someone else out by committing to an area she doesn't
        normally work on.  By preventing this sort of thing at the
        server level, you're setting up barriers to unexpected
        collaboration.  You're also creating a bunch of rules that
        need to be maintained as projects develop, new users are
        added, and so on.  It's a bunch of extra work to
        maintain.</para>

        <para>Remember that this is a version control system!  Even if
        somebody accidentally commits a change to something they
        shouldn't, it's easy to undo the change.  And if a user
        commits to the wrong place with deliberate malice, then it's a
        social problem anyway, and that the problem needs to be dealt
        with outside of Subversion.</para>

      <para>So before you begin restricting users' access rights, ask
        yourself if there's a real, honest need for this, or if it's
        just something that <quote>sounds good</quote> to an
        administrator.  Decide whether it's worth sacrificing some
        server speed for, and remember that there's very little risk
        involved; it's bad to become dependent on technology as a
        crutch for social problems.<footnote><para>A common theme in
        this book!</para></footnote>.</para>

      <para>As an example to ponder, consider that the Subversion
        project itself has always a notion of who is allowed to commit
        where, but it's always been enforced socially.  This is a good
        model of community trust, especially for open-source projects.
        Of course, sometimes there <emphasis>are</emphasis> truly
        legitimate needs for path-based access control; within
        corporations, for example, certain types of data really can be
        sensitive, and access needs to be genuinely restricted to
        small groups of people.</para>

    </sidebar>

    <para>Once your server knows where to find your rules-file, it's
      time to define the rules.</para>

    <para>The syntax of the file is the same familiar one used
      by <command>svnserve.conf</command> and the runtime
      configuration files.  Lines that start with a hash
      (<literal>#</literal>) are ignored.  In its simplest form, each
      section names a repository and path within it, and the
      authenticated usernames are the option names within each
      section.  The value of each option describes the user's level of
      access to the repository path: either
      <literal>r</literal> (read-only) or <literal>rw</literal>
      (read-write).  If the user is not mentioned at all, no access is
      allowed.</para>

    <para>To be more specific: the value of the section-names are
      either of the form <literal>[repos-name:path]</literal> or the
      form <literal>[path]</literal>.  If you're using the
      <literal>SVNParentPath</literal> directive, then it's important
      to specify the repository names in your sections.  If you omit
      them, then a section like
      <literal>[/some/dir]</literal> will match the path
      <filename>/some/dir</filename> in <emphasis>every</emphasis>
      repository.  If you're using the <literal>SVNPath</literal>
      directive, however, then it's fine to only define paths in your
      sections&mdash;after all, there's only one repository.</para>

    <para>In this first example, the user <literal>harry</literal> has
      full read and write access on the
      <filename>/branches/calc/bug-142</filename> directory in the
      <literal>calc</literal> repository, but the user
      <literal>sally</literal> has read-only access.  Any other users
      are blocked from accessing this directory.</para>

    <para>Of course, permissions are inherited from parent to child

      subdirectory of the branch, but can still only read other parts.

[calc:/branches/calc/bug-142]
harry = rw
sally = r

[calc:/branches/calc/bug-142/secret]
harry =
</screen>

    <para>In this example, Harry has read-write access to the
      entire <filename>bug-142</filename> tree, but has absolutely no
      access at all to the <filename>secret</filename> subdirectory
      within it.</para>

    <para>The thing to remember is that the most specific path always
      matches first.  The server tries to match the path itself, and
      then the parent of the path, then the parent of that, and so on.
      The net effect is that mentioning a specific path in the
      accessfile will always override any permissions inherited from
      parent directories.</para>

    <para>By default, nobody has any access to the repository at all.
      That means that if you're starting with an empty file, you'll
      probably want to give at least read permission to all users at
      the root of the repository.  You can do this by using the
      asterisk variable (<literal>*</literal>), which means <quote>all
      users</quote>:</para>

    <screen>
[/]
* = r
</screen>

    <para>This is a common setup; notice that there's no repository
      name mentioned in the section name.  This makes all repositories
      world readable to all users. Once all users have read-access to
      the repositories, you can give explicit
      <literal>rw</literal> permission to certain users on specific
      subdirectories within specific repositories.</para>

    <para>The asterisk variable (<literal>*</literal>) is also worth
      special mention here: it's the
      <emphasis>only</emphasis> pattern which matches an anonymous
      user.  If you've configured your server block to allow a mixture
      of anonymous and authenticated access, all users start out
      accessing anonymously.  The server looks for a
      <literal>*</literal> value defined for the path being accessed;
      if it can't find one, then it demands real authentication from
      the client.</para>

    <para>The access file also allows you to define whole groups of
      users, much like the Unix <filename>/etc/group</filename>
      file:</para>

    <screen>
[groups]
calc-developers = harry, sally, joe
paint-developers = frank, sally, jane
everyone = harry, sally, joe, frank, sally, jane
</screen>

    <para>Groups can be granted access control just like users.
      Distinguish them with an <quote>at</quote>
      (<literal>@</literal>) prefix:</para>

    <screen>
[calc:/projects/calc]
@calc-developers = rw

[paint:/projects/paint]
@paint-developers = rw
jane = r
</screen>

    <para>Groups can also be defined to contain other groups:</para>

    <screen>
[groups]
calc-developers = harry, sally, joe
paint-developers = frank, sally, jane
everyone = @calc-developers, @paint-developers
</screen>

    <para>&hellip;and that's pretty much all there is to it.</para>

    <title>Supporting Multiple Repository Access Methods</title>

    <para>You've seen how a repository can be accessed in many
      different ways.  But is it possible&mdash;or safe&mdash;for your
      repository to be accessed by multiple methods simultaneously?
      The answer is yes, provided you use a bit of foresight.</para>

    <para>At any given time, these processes may require read and
      write access to your repository:</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>regular system users using a Subversion client (as
          themselves) to access the repository directly via
          <literal>file:///</literal> URLs;</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>regular system users connecting to SSH-spawned private
          <command>svnserve</command> processes (running as
          themselves) which access the repository;</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>an <command>svnserve</command> process&mdash;either a
          daemon or one launched by
          <command>inetd</command>&mdash;running as a particular fixed
          user;</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>an Apache <command>httpd</command> process, running as a
          particular fixed user.</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <para>The most common problem administrators run into is repository
      ownership and permissions.  Does every process (or user) in the
      previous list have the rights to read and write the Berkeley DB
      files?  Assuming you have a Unix-like operating system, a
      straightforward approach might be to place every potential
      repository user into a new <literal>svn</literal> group, and
      make the repository wholly owned by that group.  But even that's
      not enough, because a process may write to the database files
      using an unfriendly umask&mdash;one that prevents access by
      other users.</para>

    <para>So the next step beyond setting up a common group for
      repository users is to force every repository-accessing process
      to use a sane umask.  For users accessing the repository
      directly, you can make the <command>svn</command> program into a
      wrapper script that first sets <command>umask 002</command> and
      then runs the real <command>svn</command> client program.  You
      can write a similar wrapper script for the
      <command>svnserve</command> program, and add a <command>umask
      002</command> command to Apache's own startup script,
      <filename>apachectl</filename>.  For example:</para>

    <screen>
$ cat /usr/bin/svn

#!/bin/sh

umask 002
/usr/bin/svn-real "$@"

</screen>

    <para>Another common problem is often encountered on Unix-like
      systems.  As a repository is used, Berkeley DB occasionally
      creates new log files to journal its actions.  Even if the
      repository is wholly owned by the <command>svn</command> group,
      these newly created files won't necessarily be owned by that
      same group, which then creates more permissions problems for
      your users.  A good workaround is to set the group SUID bit on
      the repository's <filename>db</filename> directory.  This causes
      all newly-created log files to have the same group owner as the
      parent directory.</para>

    <para>Once you've jumped through these hoops, your repository
      should be accessible by all the necessary processes.  It may
      seem a bit messy and complicated, but the problems of having
      multiple users sharing write-access to common files are classic
      ones that are not often elegantly solved.</para>

    <para>Fortunately, most repository administrators will never
      <emphasis>need</emphasis> to have such a complex configuration.
      Users who wish to access repositories that live on the same
      machine are not limited to using <literal>file://</literal>
      access URLs&mdash;they can typically contact the Apache HTTP
      server or <command>svnserve</command> using
      <literal>localhost</literal> for the server name in their
      <literal>http://</literal> or <literal>svn://</literal> URLs.
      And to maintain multiple server processes for your Subversion
      repositories is likely to be more of a headache than necessary.
      We recommend you choose the server that best meets your needs
      and stick with it!</para>

      <title>The svn+ssh:// server checklist</title>

      <para>It can be quite tricky to get a bunch of users with
        existing SSH accounts to share a repository without
        permissions problems.  If you're confused about all the things
        that you (as an administrator) need to do on a Unix-like
        system, here's a quick checklist that resummarizes some of
        things discussed in this section:</para>

      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>All of your SSH users need to be able to read and
            write to the repository.  Put all the SSH users into a
            single group.  Make the repository wholly owned by that
            group, and set the group permissions to read/write.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>Your users need to use a sane umask when accessing the
            repository.  Make sure that <command>svnserve</command>
            (<filename>/usr/bin/svnserve</filename>, or wherever
            it lives in <literal>$PATH</literal>) is actually a
            wrapper script which sets <command>umask 002</command> and
            executes the real <command>svnserve</command>
            binary.  Take similar measures when using
            <command>svnlook</command> and
            <command>svnadmin</command>.  Either run them with a sane
            umask, or wrap them as described above.</para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>
