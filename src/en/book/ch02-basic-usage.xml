<chapter id="svn.tour">
  <title>Basic Usage</title>

  <para>Now we will go into the details of using Subversion.  By the
    time you reach the end of this chapter, you will be able to
    perform all the tasks you need to use Subversion in a normal day's
    work.  You'll start with getting your files into Subversion,
    followed by an initial checkout of your code.  We'll then walk you
    through making changes and examining those changes.  You'll also
    see how to bring changes made by others into your working copy,
    examine them, and work through any conflicts that might
    arise.</para>

  <para>Note that this chapter is not meant to be an exhaustive list
    of all of Subversion's commands&mdash;rather, it's a conversational
    introduction to the most common Subversion tasks that you'll
    encounter.  This chapter assumes that you've read and understood
    <xref linkend="svn.basic"/> and are familiar with the general
    model of Subversion.  For a complete reference of all commands,
    see <xref linkend="svn.ref"/>.</para>

    <title>Help!</title>

    <para>Before reading on, here is the most important command you'll
      ever need when using Subversion: <command>svn help</command>.
      The Subversion command-line client is self-documenting&mdash;at
      any time, a quick <userinput>svn help
      <replaceable>subcommand</replaceable></userinput> will describe
      the syntax, options, and behavior of the subcommand.</para>

    <screen>
$ svn help import
import: Commit an unversioned file or tree into the repository.
usage: import [PATH] URL

  Recursively commit a copy of PATH to URL.
  If PATH is omitted '.' is assumed.
  Parent directories are created as necessary in the repository.
  If PATH is a directory, the contents of the directory are added
  directly under URL.
  Unversionable items such as device files and pipes are ignored
  if --force is specified.

Valid options:
  -q [--quiet]             : print nothing, or only summary information
  -N [--non-recursive]     : obsolete; try --depth=files or --depth=immediates
  --depth ARG              : limit operation by depth ARG ('empty', 'files',
                             'immediates', or 'infinity')
&hellip;

      <sidebar>
        <title>Options and Switches and Flags, Oh My!</title>
        
        <para>The Subversion command-line client has numerous command
          modifiers (which we call options), but there are two
          distinct kinds of options:  short options
          are a single hyphen followed by a single letter, and
          long options consist of two hyphens
          followed by a number of letters (e.g., <literal>-s</literal>
          and <literal>--this-is-a-long-option</literal>,
          respectively).  Every option has a long format, but only
          certain options have an additional short format (these are
          typically options that are frequently used).  To
          maintain clarity, we <emphasis>usually</emphasis> use the
          long form in code examples, but when describing options, if
          there's a short form, we'll provide the long form (to
          improve clarity) and the short form (to make it easier to
          remember).  You should use whichever one you're more
          comfortable with, but don't try to use both.</para>

    <title>Getting Data into Your Repository</title>

    <para>You can get new files into your Subversion
      repository in two ways: <command>svn import</command> and <command>svn
      add</command>.  We'll discuss <command>svn import</command> now

    <sect2 id="svn.tour.importing.import">
      <title>svn import</title>

      <para>The <command>svn import</command> command is a quick way to
        copy an unversioned tree of files into a repository, creating
        intermediate directories as necessary.  <command>svn
        import</command> doesn't require a working copy, and your files
        are immediately committed to the repository.  You typically
        use this when you have an existing tree of files that you want to
        begin tracking in your Subversion repository.  For example:</para>

      <screen>
$ svnadmin create /var/svn/newrepos
$ svn import mytree file:///var/svn/newrepos/some/project \
             -m "Initial import"
Adding         mytree/foo.c
Adding         mytree/bar.c
Adding         mytree/subdir
Adding         mytree/subdir/quux.h

Committed revision 1.
</screen>

      <para>The previous example copied the contents of directory
        <filename>mytree</filename> under the directory
        <filename>some/project</filename> in the repository:</para>

      <screen>
$ svn list file:///var/svn/newrepos/some/project
bar.c
foo.c
subdir/
</screen>

      <para>Note that after the import is finished, the original tree
        is <emphasis>not</emphasis> converted into a working copy.  To
        start working, you still need to <command>svn
        checkout</command> a fresh working copy of the tree.</para>

      <title>Recommended Repository Layout</title>

      <para>While Subversion's flexibility allows you to lay out your
      repository in any way that you choose, we recommend that you
      create a <filename>trunk</filename> directory to hold the
      <quote>main line</quote> of development, a
      <filename>branches</filename> directory to contain branch
      copies, and a <filename>tags</filename> directory to contain tag
      copies.  For example:</para>

    <title>Initial Checkout</title>

    <para>Most of the time, you will start using a Subversion
      repository by doing a <firstterm>checkout</firstterm> of your
      project.  Checking out a repository creates a <quote>working
      copy</quote> of it on your local machine.  This copy contains
      the <literal>HEAD</literal> (latest revision) of the Subversion
      repository that you specify on the command line:</para>

    <sidebar>
      <title>What's in a Name?</title>

      <para>Subversion tries hard not to limit the type of data you
        can place under version control.  The contents of files and
        property values are stored and transmitted as binary data, and
        <xref linkend="svn.advanced.props.special.mime-type"/>
        tells you how to give Subversion a hint that
        <quote>textual</quote> operations don't make sense for a
        particular file.  There are a few places, however, where
        Subversion places restrictions on information it
        stores.</para>

      <para>Subversion internally handles certain bits of
        data&mdash;for example, property names, pathnames, and log
        messages&mdash;as UTF-8-encoded Unicode.  This is not to say
        that all your interactions with Subversion must involve UTF-8,
        though.  As a general rule, Subversion clients will gracefully
        and transparently handle conversions between UTF-8 and the
        encoding system in use on your computer, if such a conversion
        can meaningfully be done (which is the case for most common
        encodings in use today).</para>

      <para>In WebDAV exchanges and older versions of some of
        Subversion's administrative files, paths are used as XML
        attribute values, and property names in XML tag names.  This
        means that pathnames can contain only legal XML (1.0)
        characters, and properties are further limited to ASCII
        characters.  Subversion also prohibits <literal>TAB</literal>,
        <literal>CR</literal>, and <literal>LF</literal> characters in
        path names to prevent paths from being broken up in diffs or
        in the output of commands such as <command>svn log</command>
        or <command>svn status</command>.</para>

      <para>While it may seem like a lot to remember, in practice
        these limitations are rarely a problem.  As long as your
        locale settings are compatible with UTF-8 and you don't use
        control characters in path names, you should have no trouble
        communicating with Subversion.  The command-line client adds
        an extra bit of help&mdash;to create
        <quote>legally correct</quote> versions for internal
        use it will automatically escape illegal
        path characters as needed in URLs that you type.</para>

    </sidebar>

    <para>Although the preceding example checks out the trunk directory,
      you can just as easily check out any deep subdirectory of a
      repository by specifying the subdirectory in the checkout
      URL:</para>

    <screen>
$ svn checkout \
      http://svn.collab.net/repos/svn/trunk/subversion/tests/cmdline/
A    cmdline/revert_tests.py
A    cmdline/diff_tests.py

</screen>

    <para>Since Subversion uses a copy-modify-merge
      model instead of lock-modify-unlock (see
      <xref linkend="svn.basic.vsn-models"/>), you can immediately
      make changes to the files and directories in your working
      copy.  Your working copy is just like any other collection of
      files and directories on your system.  You can edit and change
      it, move it around, even delete the entire working copy and
      forget about it.</para>

      <warning>
        <para>While your working copy is <quote>just like any other
          collection of files and directories on your system,</quote>
          you can edit files at will, but you must tell Subversion
          about <emphasis>everything else</emphasis> that you do.  For
          example, if you want to copy or move an item in a working
          copy, you should use <command>svn copy</command> or
          <command>svn move</command> instead of the copy and move
          commands provided by your operating system.  We'll talk more
          about them later in this chapter.</para>
      </warning>

    <para>Unless you're ready to commit the addition of a new file or
      directory or changes to existing ones, there's no need to
      further notify the Subversion server that you've done
      anything.</para>

    <sidebar>
      <title>What's with the .svn Directory?</title>

      <para>Every directory in a working copy contains an
        administrative area&mdash;a subdirectory named
        <filename>.svn</filename>.  Usually, directory listing
        commands won't show this subdirectory, but it is nevertheless
        an important directory.  Whatever you do, don't delete or
        change anything in the administrative area!  Subversion
        depends on it to manage your working copy.</para>

      <para>If you accidentally remove the <filename>.svn</filename>
        subdirectory, the easiest way to fix the problem is to remove
        the entire containing directory (a normal system deletion,
        not <command>svn delete</command>), then run <userinput>svn
        update</userinput> from a parent directory.  The Subversion
        client will download the directory you've deleted, with a
        new <filename>.svn</filename> area as well.</para>
    </sidebar>

    <para>While you can certainly check out a working copy with the
      URL of the repository as the only argument, you can also specify
      a directory after your repository URL.  This places your working
      copy in the new directory that you name.  For example:</para>

    <screen>
$  svn checkout http://svn.collab.net/repos/svn/trunk subv
A    subv/Makefile.in
A    subv/ac-helpers
A    subv/ac-helpers/install.sh
A    subv/ac-helpers/install-sh
A    subv/build.conf
&hellip;
Checked out revision 8810.
</screen>

    <para>That will place your working copy in a directory named
      <literal>subv</literal> instead of a directory named
      <literal>trunk</literal> as we did previously.  The directory
      <literal>subv</literal> will be created if it doesn't already
      exist.</para>


    <sect2 id="svn.tour.initial.disabling-password-caching">
      <title>Disabling Password Caching</title>

      <para>When you perform a Subversion operation that requires you
        to authenticate, by default Subversion tries to cache your
        authentication credentials on disk in encrypted form.
        On some systems, Subversion may be unable to encrypt your
        authentication data. You will then be asked whether you
        want to cache your credentials to disk in plaintext.
        You can choose to do so for convenience so that you don't have
        to continually reenter your password for future operations.
        If you're concerned about caching your Subversion passwords
        in plaintext and do not want to be asked about it again and
        again, you can disable caching of plaintext passwords either
        permanently, or on a server-per-server basis.</para>

      <para>To permanently disable caching of passwords in plaintext,
        you can add the line
        <literal>store-plaintext-passwords = no</literal>
        to the global section in the <filename>servers</filename>
        configuration file on the local machine.  To disable caching
        of plaintext passwords for a particular server, use the same
        setting in the appropriate group section in the
        <filename>servers</filename> configuration file.
        See <xref linkend="svn.advanced.confarea.opts"/>
        in <xref linkend="svn.customization"/> for details.</para>

      <para>You can also disable caching of authentication credentials
        entirely, regardless of whether the credentials are stored
        in encrypted form or not.</para>

      <para>To disable password caching entirely for a particular one-time
        command, pass the <option >--no-auth-cache</option > option on
        the command line.  To permanently disable caching entirely,
        you can add the line <literal>store-passwords = no</literal>
        to your local machine's Subversion configuration file.  See <xref
        linkend="svn.serverconfig.netmodel.credcache"/> for
        details.</para>

    </sect2>

    <sect2 id="svn.tour.initial.different-user">
      <title>Authenticating As a Different User</title>

      <para>Since Subversion caches auth credentials by default (both
        username and password), it conveniently remembers who you were
        acting as the last time you modified your working copy.  But
        sometimes that's not helpful&mdash;particularly if you're
        working in a shared working copy such as a system
        configuration directory or a web server document root.  In this
        case, just pass the <option>--username</option> option on the
        command line, and Subversion will attempt to authenticate as
        that user, prompting you for a password if necessary.</para>

      <title>Update Your Working Copy</title>

      <para>When working on a project with a team, you'll want to
        update your working copy to receive any changes other developers 
        on the project have made since your last update.  Use
        <command>svn update</command> to bring your working copy into

    <!-- =============================================================== -->
    <sect2 id="svn.tour.cycle.edit">
      <title>Make Changes to Your Working Copy</title>

      <para>Now you can get to work and make changes in your working
        copy.  It's usually most convenient to decide on a discrete
        change (or set of changes) to make, such as writing a new
        feature, fixing a bug, and so on.  The Subversion commands that you
        will use here are <command>svn add</command>, <command>svn
        delete</command>, <command>svn copy</command>, <command>svn
        move</command>, and <command>svn mkdir</command>.  However, if
        you are merely editing files that are already in Subversion,
        you may not need to use any of these commands until you
        commit.</para>

      <para>You can make two kinds of changes to your
        working copy: <firstterm>file changes</firstterm>
        and <firstterm>tree changes</firstterm>.  You don't need to
        tell Subversion that you intend to change a file; just make
        your changes using your text editor, word processor, graphics
        program, or whatever tool you would normally use.  Subversion
        automatically detects which files have been changed, and in
        addition, it handles binary files just as easily as it handles
        text files&mdash;and just as efficiently, too.  For tree
        changes, you can ask Subversion to <quote>mark</quote> files
        and directories for scheduled removal, addition, copying, or
        moving.  These changes may take place immediately in your
        working copy, but no additions or removals will happen in the
        repository until you commit them.</para>

      <sidebar>
        <title>Versioning Symbolic Links</title>

        <para>On non-Windows platforms, Subversion is able to version
          files of the special type <firstterm>symbolic
          link</firstterm> (or <quote>symlink</quote>).  A symlink is
          a file that acts as a sort of transparent reference to some
          other object in the filesystem, allowing programs to read
          and write to those objects indirectly by way of performing
          operations on the symlink itself.</para>

        <para>When a symlink is committed into a Subversion
          repository, Subversion remembers that the file was in fact a
          symlink, as well as the object to which the symlink
          <quote>points.</quote>  When that symlink is checked out to
          another working copy on a non-Windows system, Subversion
          reconstructs a real filesystem-level symbolic link from the
          versioned symlink.  But that doesn't in any way limit the
          usability of working copies on systems such as Windows that
          do not support symlinks.  On such systems, Subversion simply
          creates a regular text file whose contents are the path to
          which to the original symlink pointed.  While that file
          can't be used as a symlink on a Windows system, it also
          won't prevent Windows users from performing their other
          Subversion-related activities.</para> </sidebar>

      <para>Here is an overview of the five Subversion subcommands
        that you'll use most often to make tree changes:</para>

        <varlistentry>
          <term><userinput>svn add foo</userinput></term>
          <listitem>
            <para>Schedule file, directory, or symbolic link
              <filename>foo</filename> to be added to the repository.
              When you next commit, <filename>foo</filename> will
              become a child of its parent directory.  Note that if
              <filename>foo</filename> is a directory, everything
              underneath <filename>foo</filename> will be scheduled
              for addition.  If you want only to add
              <filename>foo</filename> itself, pass the
              <option>--depth empty</option> option.</para>
          </listitem>
        </varlistentry>

        <varlistentry>

          <listitem>
            <para>Schedule file, directory, or symbolic link
              <filename>foo</filename> to be deleted from the
              repository.  If <filename>foo</filename> is a file or
              link, it is immediately deleted from your working copy.
              If <filename>foo</filename> is a directory, it is not
              deleted, but Subversion schedules it for deletion.  When
              you commit your changes, <filename>foo</filename> will
              be entirely removed from your working copy and the
              repository.
              <footnote>
                <para>Of course, nothing is ever totally deleted from
                  the repository&mdash;just from the
                  <literal>HEAD</literal> of the repository.  You can
                  get back anything you delete by checking out (or
                  updating your working copy to) a revision earlier
                  than the one in which you deleted it. Also see <xref

              schedule <filename>bar</filename> for addition.  When
              <filename>bar</filename> is added to the repository on
              the next commit, its copy history is recorded (as having
              originally come from <filename>foo</filename>).
              <command>svn copy</command> does not create intermediate

        <title>Changing the Repository Without a Working Copy</title>

        <para>There <emphasis>are</emphasis> some use cases that
          immediately commit tree changes to the repository.  This
          happens only when a subcommand is operating directly on a
          URL, rather than on a working-copy path.  In particular,
          specific uses of <command>svn mkdir</command>, <command>svn
          copy</command>, <command>svn move</command>, and
          <command>svn delete</command> can work with URLs (and don't
          forget that <command>svn import</command> always makes
          changes to a URL).</para>

        <para>URL operations behave in this manner because commands
          that operate on a working copy can use the working copy as a
          sort of <quote>staging area</quote> to set up your changes
          before committing them to the repository.  Commands that
          operate on URLs don't have this luxury, so when you operate
          directly on a URL, any of the aforementioned actions represents an
          immediate commit.</para>

      </sidebar>

    <!-- =============================================================== -->
    <sect2 id="svn.tour.cycle.examine">
      <title>Examine Your Changes</title>

      <para>Once you've finished making changes, you need to commit
        them to the repository, but before you do so, it's usually a
        good idea to take a look at exactly what you've changed.  By
        examining your changes before you commit, you can make a more
        accurate log message.  You may also discover that you've
        inadvertently changed a file, and this gives you a chance to
        revert those changes before committing.  Additionally, this is
        a good opportunity to review and scrutinize changes before
        publishing them.  You can see an overview of the changes
        you've made by using <command>svn status</command>, and dig
        into the details of those changes by using <command>svn
        diff</command>.</para>

      <sidebar>
        <title>Look Ma! No Network!</title>

        <para>You can use the commands <command>svn status</command>,
          <command>svn diff</command>, and <command>svn
          revert</command> without any network access even
          if your repository <emphasis>is</emphasis> across the
          network.  This makes it easy to manage your
          changes-in-progress when you are somewhere without a network
          connection, such as traveling on an airplane, riding a
          commuter train, or hacking on the beach.
          <footnote>
            <para>And you don't have a WLAN card.  Thought
              you got us, huh?</para>
          </footnote>
        </para>

        <para>Subversion does this by keeping private caches of
          pristine versions of each versioned file inside the
          <filename>.svn</filename> administrative areas.  This allows
          Subversion to report&mdash;and revert&mdash;local
          modifications to those files <emphasis>without network
          access</emphasis>.  This cache (called the
          <quote>text-base</quote>) also allows Subversion to send the
          user's local modifications during a commit to the server as
          a compressed <firstterm>delta</firstterm> (or
          <quote>difference</quote>) against the pristine version.
          Having this cache is a tremendous benefit&mdash;even if you
          have a fast Internet connection, it's much faster to send only a
          file's changes rather than the whole file to the
          server.</para>

      </sidebar>

      <para>Subversion has been optimized to help you with this task,
        and it is able to do many things without communicating with
        the repository.  In particular, your working copy contains a
        hidden cached <quote>pristine</quote> copy of each version-controlled
        file within the <filename>.svn</filename> area.
        Because of this, Subversion can quickly show you how your
        working files have changed or even allow you to undo your
        changes without contacting the repository.</para>

        <title>See an overview of your changes</title>

        <para>To get an overview of your changes, you'll use the
          <command>svn status</command> command.  You'll probably use
          <command>svn status</command> more than any other Subversion

          <title>CVS Users: Hold That Update!</title>

          <para>You're probably used to using <command>cvs
            update</command> to see what changes you've made to your
            working copy.  <command>svn status</command> will give you
            all the information you need regarding what has changed in
            your working copy&mdash;without accessing the repository
            or potentially incorporating new changes published by
            other users.</para>

          <para>In Subversion, <command>svn update</command> does just
            that&mdash;it updates your working copy with any changes
            committed to the repository since the last time you
            updated your working copy.  You may have to break the
            habit of using the <command>update</command> command to
            see what local modifications you've made.</para>

        </sidebar>

        <para>If you run <command>svn status</command> at the top of
          your working copy with no arguments, it will detect all file
          and tree changes you've made.  Here are a few examples of
          the most common status codes that <command>svn
          status</command> can return.  (Note that the text following
          <literal>#</literal> is not
          actually printed by <command>svn status</command>.)</para>

        <para>In this output format, <command>svn status</command>
          prints six columns of characters, followed by several
          whitespace characters, followed by a file or directory name.

          and/or its contents.  The codes we listed are:</para>

        a particular file are mistakes.  Maybe you shouldn't have
        changed the file at all, or perhaps it would be easier to make
        different changes starting from scratch.</para>
 
      <para>This is a perfect opportunity to use <command>svn

      <para>Subversion reverts the file to its premodified state by

        from the <filename>.svn</filename> area.  But also note that
        <command>svn revert</command> can undo
        <emphasis>any</emphasis> scheduled operations&mdash;for
        example, you might decide that you don't want to add a new

      <note>
        <para><userinput>svn revert <replaceable>item</replaceable></userinput> has exactly the same

          your working copy and then running <userinput>svn update -r
          BASE <replaceable>item</replaceable></userinput>.  However,
          if you're reverting a file, <command>svn revert</command>
          has one very noticeable difference&mdash;it doesn't have

      <para>The <computeroutput>U</computeroutput> and
        <computeroutput>G</computeroutput> codes are no cause for
        concern; those files cleanly absorbed changes from the
        repository.  The files marked with
        <computeroutput>U</computeroutput> contained no local changes
        but were <computeroutput>U</computeroutput>pdated with changes
        from the repository.  The <computeroutput>G</computeroutput>
        stands for mer<computeroutput>G</computeroutput>ed, which
        means that the file had local changes to begin with, but the
        changes coming from the repository didn't overlap with the local
        changes.</para>

      <para>But the next two lines are part of a feature (new in
        Subversion 1.5) called <firstterm>interactive conflict
        resolution</firstterm>.  This means that the changes from the
        server overlapped with your own, and you have the opportunity
        to resolve this conflict.  The most commonly used options are
        displayed, but you can see all of the options by
        typing <replaceable>h</replaceable>:</para>

        <title>Resolving conflict differences interactively</title>

        <para>There are four different ways to resolve conflicts
          interactively&mdash;two of which allow you to selectively
          merge and edit changes, and two of which allow you to simply
          pick a version of the file and move along.</para>

        <para>If you wish to choose some combination of your local
          changes, you can use the <quote>edit</quote> command
          (<userinput>e</userinput>) to manually edit the file with
          conflict markers in a text editor (determined by the
          <literal>EDITOR</literal> environment variable).  Editing
          the file by hand in your favorite text editor is a somewhat
          low-tech way of remedying conflicts (see <xref
          linkend="svn.tour.cycle.resolve.byhand"/> for a
          walkthrough), so some people like to use fancy graphical
          merge tools instead.</para>

        <para>To use a merge tool, you need to either set the
          <literal>SVN_MERGE</literal> environment variable or define
          the <literal>merge-tool-cmd</literal> option in your
          Subversion configuration file (see <xref
          linkend="svn.advanced.confarea.opts"/> for more details).
          Subversion will pass four arguments to the merge tool: the
          <literal>BASE</literal> revision of the file, the revision
          of the file received from the server as part of the update,
          the copy of the file containing your local edits, and
          the merged copy of the file (which contains conflict
          markers).  If your merge tool is expecting arguments in a
          different order or format, you'll need to write a wrapper
          script for Subversion to invoke.  After you've edited the
          file, if you're satisfied with the changes you've made, you
          can tell Subversion that the edited file is no longer in
          conflict by using the <quote>resolve</quote> command
          (<literal>r</literal>).</para>

          <!-- TODO(fitz): I think the above detail on the merge tool -->
          <!-- should probably be in ch07 -->

        <para>If you decide that you don't need to merge any changes,
          but just want to accept one version of the file or the
          other, you can either choose your changes (a.k.a.
          <quote>mine</quote>) by using the <quote>mine-full</quote>
          command (<userinput>mf</userinput>) or choose theirs by using the
          <quote>theirs-full</quote> command
          (<userinput>tf</userinput>).</para>

        <title>Postponing conflict resolution</title>

        <para>This may sound like an appropriate section for avoiding
          marital disagreements, but it's actually still about
          Subversion, so read on.  If you're doing an update and
          encounter a conflict that you're not prepared to review or
          resolve, you can type <userinput>p</userinput> to postpone
          resolving a conflict on a file-by-file basis when you run
          <userinput>svn update</userinput>.  If you're running an update
          and don't want to resolve any conflicts, you can pass the
          <option>--non-interactive</option> option to <command>svn
          update</command>, and any file in conflict will be marked
          with a <computeroutput>C</computeroutput>
          automatically.</para>

        <para>The <computeroutput>C</computeroutput> stands for
          <computeroutput>c</computeroutput>onflict.  This means that
          the changes from the server overlapped with your own, and
          now you have to manually choose between them after the
          update has completed.  When you postpone a conflict
          resolution, <command>svn</command> typically does three
          things to assist you in noticing and resolving that
          conflict:</para>

        <itemizedlist>

          <listitem>
            <para>Subversion prints a <computeroutput>C</computeroutput>
              during the update and remembers that the file is in a
              state of conflict.</para>

          <listitem>
            <para>If Subversion considers the file to be mergeable, it
              places <firstterm>conflict
              markers</firstterm>&mdash;special strings of text that
              delimit the <quote>sides</quote> of the
              conflict&mdash;into the file to visibly demonstrate the
              overlapping areas.  (Subversion uses the
              <literal>svn:mime-type</literal> property to decide whether a
              file is capable of contextual, line-based merging.  See
              <xref linkend="svn.advanced.props.special.mime-type"/>
              to learn more.)</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para>For every conflicted file, Subversion places three
              extra unversioned files in your working copy:</para>

                    your latest changes in it.  (If Subversion considers
                    the file to be unmergeable, the

        <para>Merging conflicts by hand can be quite intimidating the

          can become as easy as falling off a bike.</para>

        <para>Here's an example.  Due to a miscommunication, you and
          Sally, your collaborator, both edit the file
          <filename>sandwich.txt</filename> at the same time.  Sally
          commits her changes, and when you go to update your working
          copy, you get a conflict and you're going to have to edit
          <filename>sandwich.txt</filename> to resolve the conflict.
          First, let's take a look at the file:</para>

    <para>Your Subversion repository is like a time machine.  It keeps
      a record of every change ever committed and allows you to

      directories as well as the metadata that accompanies them.  With
      a single Subversion command, you can check out the repository
      (or restore an existing working copy) exactly as it was at any

      <para>Note that the log messages are printed in
        <emphasis>reverse chronological order</emphasis> by default.
        If you wish to see a different range of revisions in a

        for those revisions in which the working file (or URL)
        changed.</para>

      <sidebar>

        <title>Why Does svn log Not Show Me What I
          Just Committed?</title>

        <para>If you make a commit and immediately type <userinput>svn
          log</userinput> with no arguments, you may notice that your
          most recent commit doesn't show up in the list of log
          messages.  This is due to a combination of the behavior of
          <command>svn commit</command> and the default behavior of
          <command>svn log</command>.  First, when you commit changes
          to the repository, <command>svn</command> bumps only the
          revision of files (and directories) that it commits, so
          usually the parent directory remains at the older revision
          (See
          <xref linkend="svn.basic.in-action.mixedrevs.update-commit"/>
          for an explanation of why).  <command>svn log</command> then
          defaults to fetching the history of the directory at its
          current revision, and thus you don't see the newly committed
          changes.  The solution here is to either update your working
          copy or explicitly provide a revision number to <command>svn
          log</command> by using the <option>--revision</option>
          (<option>-r</option>) option.</para>

      </sidebar>

      <para>If you want even more information about a file or
        directory, <command>svn log</command> also takes a
        <option>--verbose</option> (<option>-v</option>) option.
        Because Subversion allows you to move and copy files and
        directories, it is important to be able to track path changes
        in the filesystem. So, in verbose mode, <command>svn
        log</command> will include a list of changed paths in a
        revision in its output:</para>

      <screen>
$ svn log -r 8 -v
------------------------------------------------------------------------
r8 | sally | 2008-05-21 13:19:25 -0500 (Wed, 21 May 2008) | 1 line
Changed paths:
   M /trunk/code/foo.c
   M /trunk/code/bar.h
   A /trunk/code/doc/README

Frozzled the sub-space winch.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
</screen>

      <para>
        <command>svn log</command> also takes a <option>--quiet</option>
        (<option>-q</option>) option, which suppresses the body of the
        log message.  When combined with <option>--verbose</option>, it
        gives just the names of the changed files.</para>

      <sidebar>
        <title>Why Does svn log Give Me an Empty
          Response?</title>

        <para>After working with Subversion for a bit, most users will
          come across something like this:</para>

        <screen>
$ svn log -r 2
------------------------------------------------------------------------
$
</screen>

        <para>At first glance, this seems like an error.  But recall
          that while revisions are repository-wide, <command>svn
          log</command> operates on a path in the repository.  If you
          supply no path, Subversion uses the current working
          directory as the default target.  As a result, if you're
          operating in a subdirectory of your working copy and attempt
          to see the log of a revision in which neither that directory
          nor any of its children was changed, Subversion will show you
          an empty log.  If you want to see what changed in that
          revision, try pointing <command>svn log</command> directly at
          the topmost URL of your repository, as in <userinput>svn log -r 2
          http://svn.collab.net/repos/svn</userinput>.</para>

    <title>Sometimes You Just Need to Clean Up</title>

    <para>Now that we've covered the day-to-day tasks that you'll
      frequently use Subversion for, we'll review a few administrative
      tasks relating to your working copy.</para>


    <sect2 id="svn.tour.cleanup.disposal">

      <title>Disposing of a Working Copy</title>

      <para>Subversion doesn't track either the state or the existence of
        working copies on the server, so there's no server overhead to
        keeping working copies around.  Likewise, there's no need to
        let the server know that you're going to delete a working
        copy.</para>

      <para>If you're likely to use a working copy again, there's
        nothing wrong with just leaving it on disk until you're ready
        to use it again, at which point all it takes is an
        <command>svn update</command> to bring it up to date and ready
        for use.</para>

      <para>However, if you're definitely not going to use a working
        copy again, you can safely delete the entire thing, but you'd
        be well served to take a look through the working copy for
        unversioned files.  To find these files, run <userinput>svn
        status</userinput> and review any files that are prefixed with a
        <literal>?</literal> to make certain that they're not of
        importance.  After you're done reviewing, you can safely
        delete your working copy.</para>

    </sect2>

    <sect2 id="svn.tour.cleanup.interruption">

      <title>Recovering from an Interruption</title>

      <para>When Subversion modifies your working copy (or any
        information within <filename>.svn</filename>), it tries to do
        so as safely as possible.  Before changing the working copy,
        Subversion writes its intentions to a logfile.  Next, it
        executes the commands in the logfile to apply the requested
        change, holding a lock on the relevant part of the working
        copy while it works&mdash;to prevent other Subversion clients
        from accessing the working copy mid-change.  Finally,
        Subversion removes the logfile.  Architecturally, this is
        similar to a journaled filesystem.  If a Subversion operation
        is interrupted (e.g, if the process is killed or if the machine
        crashes), the logfiles remain on disk.  By
        reexecuting the logfiles, Subversion can complete the
        previously started operation, and your working copy can get
        itself back into a consistent state.</para>

      <para>And this is exactly what <command>svn cleanup</command>
        does: it searches your working copy and runs any leftover
        logs, removing working copy locks in the process.
        If Subversion ever tells you that some part of your working copy
        is <quote>locked,</quote> this is the command that you
        should run.  Also, <command>svn status</command> will display
        an <literal>L</literal> next to locked items:</para>

      <screen>
$ svn status
  L    somedir
M      somedir/foo.c

$ svn cleanup
$ svn status
M      somedir/foo.c
</screen>

      <para>Don't confuse these working copy locks with the ordinary
        locks that Subversion users create when using
        the lock-modify-unlock model of concurrent
        version control; see the sidebar
        <xref linkend="svn.advanced.locking.meanings"/> for
        clarification.</para>

  <sect1 id="svn.tour.treeconflicts">
    <title>Dealing with Structural Conflicts</title>
      
      <para>So far, we have only talked about conflicts at the level
        of file content. When you and your collaborators make overlapping
        changes within the same file, Subversion forces you to merge those
        changes before you can commit.<footnote><para>Well, you could mark
        files containing conflict markers as resolved and commit them,
        if you really wanted to. But this is rarely done in practice.</para>
        </footnote></para>
        
      <para>But what happens if your collaborators move or delete a file
        that you are still working on? Maybe there was a miscommunication,
        and one person thinks the file should be deleted, while another
        person still wants to commit changes to the file. Or maybe your
        collaborators did some refactoring, renaming files and moving
        around directories in the process. If you were still working on
        these files, those modifications may need to be applied to the
        files at their new location. Such conflicts manifest themselves at
        the directory tree structure level rather than at the file content
        level, and are known as <firstterm>tree conflicts</firstterm>.</para>

      <sidebar>
        <title>Tree conflicts prior to Subversion 1.6</title>

        <para>Prior to Subversion 1.6, tree conflicts could yield
          rather unexpected results. For example, if a file was
          locally modified, but had been renamed in the repository,
          running <command>svn update</command> would make Subversion
          carry out the following steps:</para>

        <itemizedlist>
          <listitem><para>Check the file to be renamed for local
            modifications.</para></listitem>

          <listitem><para>Delete the file at its old location, and
            if it had local modifications, keep an on-disk copy
            of the file at the old location. This on-disk copy
            now appears as an unversioned file in the working
            copy.</para></listitem>

          <listitem><para>Add the file, as it exists in the repository,
            at its new location.</para></listitem>
        </itemizedlist>

        <para>When this situation arises, there is the possibility
          that the user makes a commit without realizing that local
          modifications have been left in a now-unversioned file in
          the working copy, and have not reached the repository.
          This gets more and more likely (and tedious) if the number
          of files affected by this problem is large.</para>

        <para>Since Subversion 1.6, this and other similar situations
          are flagged as conflicts in the working copy.</para>

      </sidebar>

      <para>As with textual conflicts, tree conflicts prevent a commit
        from being made from the conflicted state, giving the user the
        opportunity to examine the state of the working copy for potential
        problems arising from the tree conflict, and resolving any such
        problems before committing.</para>

      <para>Because a move in Subversion is implemented as a copy operation
        followed by a delete operation, and these two operations cannot
        be easily related to one another during an update, all Subversion
        can warn you about is an incoming delete operation on a locally
        modified file.
        This delete operation <emphasis>may</emphasis> be part of a move,
        or it could be a genuine delete operation. Talking to your
        collaborators, or, as a last resort, <command>svn log</command>,
        is a good way to find out what has actually happened.</para>

      <para>Both <filename>foo.c</filename> and <filename>baz.c</filename>

      <para>
        The answer is that despite the limitations of the move implementation,
