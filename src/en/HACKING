This style guide is intended to be *an addition to* the O'Reilly and
Associates style guide at http://www.ora.com/oreilly/author/stylesheet.html
===========================================================================


===========
PROSE GUIDE
===========


Tone: somewhere between formal and informal. 
      For example:
      - We use contractions
      - We don't say things like "You see"

- Always title sidebars  

- High level chapter outline: 
  - This is what I'm going to tell you.
  - I'm telling you this *right now*.
  - This is what I told you.

- We have a "Version Control System", NOT a "Revision Control
  System"

- We have "working copies", not "working directories"

- Always use long Subversion commands (e.g. "checkout", not "co", etc)

- We perform "commits"; we don't "check in" or do "checkins"

- They are URL "schemes"; not "schemas".

- Use double-quotes with spaceful command-line arguments instead of single-
  quotes wherever possible, to increase the likelihood of the command
  working on Windows.

- No first-level section should assume that the reader has read any
  other first-level section in the book, unless it explicitly states
  that such an assumption is being made (or rather, recommends that
  the reader first visit said other section).


================
SUBVERSION GUIDE
================


- Our sample repository will be its own repository that all
  examples come from and it will be publically accessible. ###TODO

- Primary user: Sally

- Secondary user: Harry

- Tertiary user: Ira

- Primary client machine: newyork

- Primary server machine/URL: svn.red-bean.com


============
MARKUP GUIDE
============


- We use commented-out divider lines to help us quickly locate section
  boundaries.

- The book is using the DocBook 4.4 DTD, which maybe be found in our
  source tree.

- You should *always* validate your xml before checking in.  Do not
  check in xml that is not well-formed.  See the README for how to
  validate your xml.

- Screen output and program listings should be limited to 78 characters
  in width.  Use backslash ('\') as a line continuation character.

- All markup should be properly indented, with the exception of
  <screen> and <programlisting>blocks, which (save for their opening
  tag) should be aligned all the way to the left:

         <para>This is what that output looks like:</para>

         <screen>
     $ svn --version --quiet
     1.5.0-rc1
     $
     </screen>

         <para>See how concise that was?</para>

- We keep 
- Markup options with aliases like so:

     <option>--revision (-r)</option>

  not like:

     <option>--revision</option> (<option>-r</option>)


====================
PRE-PROCESSING NEEDS
====================


Because of the way we've chosen to format our XML (with a goal of
increased readability), there are some pre-processing steps required
to get technically correct formatting of our rendered book contents:

- Any whitespace after a <screen> or <programlisting> tag, up to and
  including the first carriage return, should be removed.

- Whitespace (including carriage returns) before a <footnote> tag and
  after a </footnote> tag should be removed.


==================
ABBREVIATION RULES
==================


- Subcommand names: we always use long names of subcommands,
  e.g. "checkout", not "co".  This goes for both prose and examples.

- Options, not switches: Those --blorg things are called options and
  not switches.  Don't ever call them switches.

- Option names:

    - By default, identify an option by *both* its long and
      short name in the prose, e.g. "use the --revision (-r) option to
      do blah..."

    - For examples (those in <screen> tags, as we as those embedded in
      the prose with <command> tags), use the short version, so as to
      be more realistic and get users comfortable with the
      abbreviations.


=============
MISCELLANEOUS
=============


- Anything that needs attention or fixing should be marked with
  ###TODO so that it's easy to find. Also, please add your userid to
  any inline comments to facilitate discussion 'in the code.'

- Do you want to mention svnbook.el in here?  Note that it's already
  mentioned in the top-level HACKING file.  Maybe this HACKING file
  should be merged into that one?  I dunno, you guys make the call.
