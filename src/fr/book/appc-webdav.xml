  <title>WebDAV and Autoversioning</title>

  <para>WebDAV is an extension to HTTP, and it is growing more and more
    popular as a standard for file sharing.  Today's operating systems
    are becoming extremely web-aware, and many now have built-in
    support for mounting <quote>shares</quote> exported by WebDAV
    servers.</para>

  <para>If you use Apache as your Subversion network server, to
    some extent you are also running a WebDAV server.  This appendix
    gives some background on the nature of this protocol, how
    Subversion uses it, and how well Subversion interoperates with
    other software that is WebDAV-aware.</para>

    <title>What Is WebDAV?</title>

    <para><firstterm>DAV</firstterm> stands for <quote>Distributed
      Authoring and Versioning.</quote>  RFC 2518 defines a set of
      concepts and accompanying extension methods to HTTP 1.1 that
      make the Web a more universal read/write medium.  The basic
      idea is that a WebDAV-compliant web server can act like a
      generic file server; clients can <quote>mount</quote> shared
      folders over HTTP that behave much like other network
      filesystems (such as NFS or SMB).</para>

    <para>The tragedy, though, is that despite the acronym, the RFC
      specification doesn't actually describe any sort of version
      control.  Basic WebDAV clients and servers assume that only one
      version of each file or directory exists, and that it can be
      repeatedly overwritten.</para>

    <para>Because RFC 2518 left out versioning concepts, another
      committee was left with the responsibility of writing RFC 3253 a
      few years later.  The new RFC adds versioning concepts to
      WebDAV, placing the <quote>V</quote> back in
      <quote>DAV</quote>&mdash;hence the term <quote>DeltaV.</quote>
      WebDAV/DeltaV clients and servers are often called just
      <quote>DeltaV</quote> programs, since DeltaV implies the
      existence of basic WebDAV.</para>

    <para>The original WebDAV standard has been widely successful.
      Every modern computer operating system has a general WebDAV
      client built in (details to follow), and a number of popular
      standalone applications are also able to speak
      WebDAV&mdash;Microsoft Office, Dreamweaver, and Photoshop, to
      name a few.  On the server end, Apache HTTP Server has been
      able to provide WebDAV services since 1998 and is considered the
      de facto open source standard.  Several other
      commercial WebDAV servers are available, including Microsoft's own
      IIS.</para>

    <para>DeltaV, unfortunately, has not been so successful.  It's
      very difficult to find any DeltaV clients or servers.  The few
      that do exist are relatively unknown commercial products, and
      thus it's very difficult to test interoperability.  It's not
      entirely clear as to why DeltaV has remained stagnant.  Some
      opine that the specification is just too complex.  Others argue
      that while WebDAV's features have mass appeal (even the least
      technical users appreciate network file sharing), its version
      control features just aren't interesting or necessary for most
      users.  Finally, some believe that DeltaV remains unpopular
      because there's still no open source server product that
      implements it well.</para>

    <para>When Subversion was still in its design phase, it seemed
      like a great idea to use Apache as a network server.  It already
      had a module to provide WebDAV services.  DeltaV was a
      relatively new specification.  The hope was that the Subversion
      server module (<command>mod_dav_svn</command>) would eventually
      evolve into an open source DeltaV reference implementation.
      Unfortunately, DeltaV has a very specific versioning model that
      doesn't quite line up with Subversion's model.  Some concepts
      were mappable; others were not.</para>

    <para>What does this mean, then?</para>

    <para>First, the Subversion client is not a fully implemented
      DeltaV client.  It needs certain types of things from the server
      that DeltaV itself cannot provide, and thus is largely dependent
      on a number of Subversion-specific
      HTTP <literal>REPORT</literal> requests that
      only <command>mod_dav_svn</command> understands.</para>

    <para>Second, <command>mod_dav_svn</command> is not a
      fully realized DeltaV server.  Many portions of the DeltaV
      specification were irrelevant to Subversion, and thus were left
      unimplemented.</para>

    <para>There is still some debate in the developer community as to
      whether or not it's worthwhile to remedy either of these
      situations.  It's fairly unrealistic to change Subversion's
      design to match DeltaV, so there's probably no way the client
      can ever learn to get everything it needs from a general DeltaV
      server.  On the other hand,
      <command>mod_dav_svn</command> <emphasis>could</emphasis> be
      further developed to implement all of DeltaV, but it's hard to
      find motivation to do so&mdash;there are almost no DeltaV
      clients to interoperate with.</para>

    <title>Autoversioning</title>

    <para>While the Subversion client is not a full DeltaV client, and
      the Subversion server is not a full DeltaV server, there's still a
      glimmer of WebDAV interoperability to be happy about:
      <firstterm>autoversioning</firstterm>.</para>

    <para>Autoversioning is an optional feature defined in the DeltaV
      standard.  A typical DeltaV server will reject an ignorant
      WebDAV client attempting to do a <literal>PUT</literal> to a
      file that's under version control.  To change a
      version-controlled file, the server expects a series of proper
      versioning requests: something like
      <literal>MKACTIVITY</literal>, <literal>CHECKOUT</literal>,
      <literal>PUT</literal>, <literal>CHECKIN</literal>.  But if the
      DeltaV server supports autoversioning, write requests from
      basic WebDAV clients are accepted.  The server behaves as though the
      client <emphasis>had</emphasis> issued the proper series of
      versioning requests, performing a commit under the hood.  In
      other words, it allows a DeltaV server to interoperate with
      ordinary WebDAV clients that don't understand versioning.</para>

    <para>Because so many operating systems already have integrated
      WebDAV clients, the use case for this feature can be incredibly
      appealing to administrators working with non-technical users.
      Imagine an office of ordinary users running Microsoft Windows or
      Mac OS.  Each user <quote>mounts</quote> the Subversion
      repository, which appears to be an ordinary network folder.
      They use the shared folder as they always do:  open files, edit
      them, and save them.  Meanwhile, the server is automatically
      versioning everything.  Any administrator (or knowledgeable
      user) can still use a Subversion client to search history and
      retrieve older versions of data.</para>

    <para>This scenario isn't fiction&mdash;it's real and it works, as
      of Subversion 1.2 and later.  To activate autoversioning in
      <command>mod_dav_svn</command>, use the
      <literal>SVNAutoversioning</literal> directive within the
      <filename>httpd.conf</filename> <literal>Location</literal>
      block, like so:</para>

    <screen>
&lt;Location /repos&gt;
  DAV svn
  SVNPath /var/svn/repository
  SVNAutoversioning on
&lt;/Location&gt;
</screen>

    <para>When Subversion autoversioning is active, write requests
      from WebDAV clients result in automatic commits.  A generic log
      message is automatically generated and attached to each
      revision.</para>

    <para>Before activating this feature, however, understand what
      you're getting into.  WebDAV clients tend to do
      <emphasis>many</emphasis> write requests, resulting in a huge
      number of automatically committed revisions.  For example, when
      saving data, many clients will do a <literal>PUT</literal> of a
      0-byte file (as a way of reserving a name) followed by another
      <literal>PUT</literal> with the real file data.  The single
      file-write results in two separate commits.  Also consider that
      many applications auto-save every few minutes, resulting in even
      more commits.</para>

    <para>If you have a post-commit hook program that sends email, you
      may want to disable email generation either altogether or on
      certain sections of the repository; it depends on whether you
      think the influx of emails will still prove to be valuable
      notifications or not.  Also, a smart post-commit hook program
      can distinguish between a transaction created via autoversioning
      and one created through a normal Subversion commit operation.
      The trick is to look for a revision property
      named <literal>svn:autoversioned</literal>.  If present, the
      commit was made by a generic WebDAV client.</para>

    <para>Another feature that may be a useful complement for
      Subversion's autoversioning comes from Apache's
      <literal>mod_mime</literal> module.  If a WebDAV client adds a
      new file to the repository, there's no opportunity for the user
      to set the the <literal>svn:mime-type</literal> property.  This
      might cause the file to appear as a generic icon when viewed
      within a WebDAV shared folder, not having an association with
      any application.  One remedy is to have a sysadmin (or other
      Subversion-knowledgeable person) check out a working copy and
      manually set the <literal>svn:mime-type</literal> property on
      necessary files. But there's potentially no end to such cleanup
      tasks.  Instead, you can use the
      <literal>ModMimeUsePathInfo</literal> directive in your
      Subversion <literal>&lt;Location&gt;</literal> block:</para>

    <screen>
&lt;Location /repos&gt;
  DAV svn
  SVNPath /var/svn/repository
  SVNAutoversioning on

  ModMimeUsePathInfo on

&lt;/Location&gt;
</screen>

    <para>This directive allows <literal>mod_mime</literal> to attempt
      automatic deduction of the MIME type on new files that enter the
      repository via autoversioning.  The module looks at the file's
      named extension and possibly the contents as well; if the file
      matches some common patterns, the
      file's <literal>svn:mime-type</literal> property will be set
      automatically.</para>

        <para>DAV Explorer is another standalone WebDAV client, written
          in Java.  It's under a free Apache-like license and is
          available at <ulink url="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~webdav/"/>.
          It does everything cadaver does, but has the
          advantages of being portable and being a more user-friendly GUI
          application.  It's also one of the first clients to support
          the new WebDAV Access Control Protocol (RFC 3744).</para>

        <para>Of course, DAV Explorer's ACL support is useless in this

        <title>Microsoft Web Folders</title>

        <para>Microsoft was one of the original backers of the WebDAV
          specification, and first started shipping a client in
          Windows 98, which was known as Web Folders.  This client was
          also shipped in Windows NT 4.0 and Windows 2000.</para>

        <para>The original Web Folders client was an extension to
          Explorer, the main GUI program used to browse filesystems.  It
          works well enough.  In Windows 98, the feature might need to
          be explicitly installed if Web Folders aren't already visible
          inside My Computer.  In Windows 2000, simply
          add a new <quote>network place,</quote> enter the URL, and the
          WebDAV share will pop up for browsing.</para>

        <para>With the release of Windows XP, Microsoft started shipping
          a new implementation of Web Folders, known as the WebDAV
          Mini-Redirector.  The new implementation is a
          filesystem-level client, allowing WebDAV shares to be mounted
          as drive letters.  Unfortunately, this implementation is
          incredibly buggy.  The client usually tries to convert HTTP
          URLs (<literal>http://host/repos</literal>) into UNC share
          notation (<literal>\\host\repos</literal>); it also often
          tries to use Windows Domain authentication to respond to
          basic-auth HTTP challenges, sending usernames as
          <literal>HOST\username</literal>.  These interoperability
          problems are severe and are documented in numerous places around
          the Web, to the frustration of many users.  Even Greg Stein,
          the original author of Apache's WebDAV module, bluntly
          states that XP Web Folders simply can't operate against an Apache
          server.</para>

        <para>Windows Vista's initial implementation of Web Folders seems to
          be almost the same as XP's, so it has the same sort of
          problems.  With luck, Microsoft will remedy these issues in
          a Vista Service Pack.</para>

        <para>However, there seem to be workarounds for both XP and
          Vista that allow Web Folders to work against Apache.  Users
          have mostly reported success with these techniques, so we'll
          relay them here.</para>

        <para>On Windows XP, you have two options.  First, search
          Microsoft's web site for update KB90730, <quote>Software
          Update for Web Folders.</quote>  This may fix all your
          problems.  If it doesn't, it seems that the original pre-XP
          Web Folders implementation is still buried within the
          system.  You can unearth it by going to Network
          Places and adding a new network place.  When prompted,
          enter the URL of the repository, but <emphasis>include a
          port number</emphasis> in the URL.  For
          example, you should enter <userinput>http://host/repos</userinput> 
          as <userinput>http://host:80/repos</userinput> instead.
          Respond to any authentication prompts with your Subversion
          credentials.</para>

        <para>On Windows Vista, the same KB90730 update may clear
          everything up.  But there may still be other issues.  Some
          users have reported that Vista considers
          all <literal>http://</literal> connections insecure, and thus
          will always fail any authentication challenges from Apache
          unless the connection happens
          over <literal>https://</literal>.  If you're unable to connect
          to the Subversion repository via SSL, you can tweak the
          system registry to turn off this behavior.  Just change the
          value of the <literal>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\WebClient\Parameters\BasicAuthLevel</literal>
          key from <userinput>1</userinput> to <userinput>2</userinput>.  A final warning:  be sure to set up the Web
          Folder to point to the repository's root directory
          (<filename>/</filename>), rather than some subdirectory
          such as <filename>/trunk</filename>.  Vista Web Folders
          seems to work only against repository roots.</para>

        <para>In general, while these workarounds may function for
          you, you might get a better overall experience using a
          third-party WebDAV client such as WebDrive or NetDrive.</para>

        <para>Nautilus is the official file manager/browser for the

          Konqueror is the manager/browser for the KDE desktop (<ulink
          url="http://www.kde.org"/>).  Both of these applications
          have an explorer-level WebDAV client built in, and they
          operate just fine against an autoversioning repository.</para>

        <para>In GNOME's Nautilus, select the <guimenuitem>File&rarr;Open
          location</guimenuitem> menu item and enter the URL in the
          dialog box presented.  The repository should then be
          displayed like any other filesystem.</para>

        <para>In KDE's Konqueror, you need to use the
          <literal>webdav://</literal> scheme when entering the URL in
          the location bar.  If you enter
          an <literal>http://</literal> URL, Konqueror will behave
          like an ordinary web browser.  You'll likely see the generic
          HTML directory listing produced
          by <command>mod_dav_svn</command>.  When you enter
          <userinput>webdav://host/repos</userinput> instead of
          <userinput>http://host/repos</userinput>, Konqueror becomes a
          WebDAV client and displays the repository as a

      <title>WebDAV Filesystem Implementation</title>

      <para>The WebDAV filesystem implementation is arguably the best
        sort of WebDAV client.  It's implemented as a low-level
        filesystem module, typically within the operating system's
        kernel.  This means that the DAV share is mounted like any
        other network filesystem, similar to mounting an NFS share on
        Unix or attaching an SMB share as a drive letter in Windows.
        As a result, this sort of client provides completely
        transparent read/write WebDAV access to all programs.
        Applications aren't even aware that WebDAV requests are
        happening.</para>

        <para>Both WebDrive and NetDrive are excellent commercial
          products that allow a WebDAV share to be attached as drive
          letters in Windows.  As a result, you can operate on the
          contents of these WebDAV-backed pseudodrives as easily as
          you can against real local hard drives, and in the same
          ways.  You can purchase WebDrive from South River
          Technologies (<ulink url="http://www.southrivertech.com"/>).
          Novell's NetDrive is freely available online, but requires
          users to have a NetWare license.</para>

        <para>Apple's OS X operating system has an integrated
          filesystem-level WebDAV client.  From the Finder, select the
          <guimenuitem>Go&rarr;Connect to Server</guimenuitem> menu
          item.  Enter a WebDAV URL, and it appears as a disk on the
          desktop, just like any other mounted volume.  You can also
          mount a WebDAV share from the Darwin terminal by using the
          <literal>webdav</literal> filesystem type with the
          <command>mount</command> command:</para>

        <screen>
$ mount -t webdav http://svn.example.com/repos/project /some/mountpoint
$
</screen>

        <para>Note that if your <command>mod_dav_svn</command> is
          older than version 1.2, OS X will refuse to mount the share
          as read/write; it will appear as read-only.  This is because
          OS X insists on locking support for read/write shares, and
          the ability to lock files first appeared in Subversion
          1.2.</para>

        <para>Also, OS X's WebDAV client can sometimes be overly
          sensitive to HTTP redirects.  If OS X is unable to mount the
          repository at all, you may need to enable the <literal>BrowserMatch</literal>
          directive in the Apache server's
