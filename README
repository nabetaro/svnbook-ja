NOTE TO BOOK AUTHORS
====================

Use the book-dist.py script in the book source directory (next to the
Makefile) to create a tarball suitable for upload and expansion here.
Turns out we must use the book source's "install-*" rules in order to
get images and stuff in the right places for all book formats.
