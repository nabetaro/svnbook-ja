Here are some things that we do for readability in our sources but
which actually are incorrect, and which might need to processing when
transforming our Docbook XML into other formats:

1.  Our <screen> and <programlisting> tags begin with a single stray
    newline.  We do this:

           <screen>
       This is the first line.
       This is the second line.
       </screen>

    but should do this:

           <screen>This is the first line.
       This is the second line.
       </screen>

2.  We have space between our footnote anchors and the text to which
    they apply.  We do this:

       Body text.
       <footnote>
         <para>This is footnote text.</para>
       </footnote>
       More body text.

    but should do this:

       Body text.<footnote>
         <para>This is footnote text.</para>
       </footnote>
       More body text.
