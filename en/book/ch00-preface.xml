  <para>In the world of open source software, the Concurrent Versions
    System (CVS) was the tool of choice for version control for many
    years.  And rightly so.  CVS was open source software itself, and
    its nonrestrictive modus operandi and support for networked
    operation allowed dozens of geographically dispersed programmers
    to share their work.  It fit the collaborative nature of the
    open source world very well.  CVS and its semi-chaotic development
    model have since become cornerstones of open source
    culture.</para>

  <para>But CVS was not without its flaws, and simply fixing those
    flaws promised to be an enormous effort.  Enter Subversion.
    Subversion was designed to be a successor to CVS, and its
    originators set out to win the hearts of CVS users in two
    ways&mdash;by creating an open source system with a design
    (and <quote>look and feel</quote>) similar to CVS, and by
    attempting to avoid most of CVS's noticeable flaws.  While the
    result wasn't&mdash;and isn't&mdash;the next great evolution in
    version control design, Subversion <emphasis>is</emphasis> very
    powerful, very usable, and very flexible.</para>

  <para>This book is written to document the 1.7 series of the Apache
    Subversion&trade;<footnote><para>We'll refer to it simply
    as <quote>Subversion</quote> throughout this book.  You'll thank
    us when you realize just how much space that
    saves!</para></footnote> version control system.  We have made
    every attempt to be thorough in our coverage.  However, Subversion
    has a thriving and energetic development community, so already a
    number of features and improvements are planned for future
    versions that may change some of the commands and specific notes
    in this book.</para>

    <para>Subversion is a free/open source <firstterm>version control
      system</firstterm> (VCS).  That is, Subversion manages files and
      directories, and the changes made to them, over time.  This
      allows you to recover older versions of your data or examine the
      history of how your data changed.  In this regard, many people
      think of a version control system as a sort of <quote>time
      machine.</quote></para>
    
    <para>Subversion can operate across networks, which allows it to
      be used by people on different computers.  At some level, the
      ability for various people to modify and manage the same set of
      data from their respective locations fosters collaboration.
      Progress can occur more quickly without a single conduit through
      which all modifications must occur.  And because the work is
      versioned, you need not fear that quality is the trade-off for
      losing that conduit&mdash;if some incorrect change is made to
      the data, just undo that change.</para>

    <para>Some version control systems are also <firstterm>software
      configuration management</firstterm> (SCM) systems.  These
      systems are specifically tailored to manage trees of source code
      and have many features that are specific to software
      development&mdash;such as natively understanding programming
      languages, or supplying tools for building software.
      Subversion, however, is not one of these systems.  It is a
      general system that can be used to manage
      <emphasis>any</emphasis> collection of files.  For you, those
      files might be source code&mdash;for others, anything from
      grocery shopping lists to digital video mixdowns and
      beyond.</para>

    <sect2 id="svn.intro.righttool">
  
      <title>Is Subversion the Right Tool?</title>
  
      <para>If you're a user or system administrator pondering the use
        of Subversion, the first question you should ask yourself is:
        "Is this the right tool for the job?"  Subversion is a
        fantastic hammer, but be careful not to view every problem as
        a nail.</para>

      <para>If you need to archive old versions of files and
        directories, possibly resurrect them, or examine logs of how
        they've changed over time, then Subversion is exactly the
        right tool for you.  If you need to collaborate with people on
        documents (usually over a network) and keep track of who made
        which changes, then Subversion is also appropriate.  This is
        why Subversion is so often used in software development
        environments&mdash;working on a development team is an
        inherently social activity, and Subversion makes it easy to
        collaborate with other programmers.  Of course, there's a cost
        to using Subversion as well: administrative overhead.  You'll
        need to manage a data repository to store the information and
        all its history, and be diligent about backing it up.  When
        working with the data on a daily basis, you won't be able to
        copy, move, rename, or delete files the way you usually do.
        Instead, you'll have to do all of those things through
        Subversion.</para>

      <para>Assuming you're fine with the extra workflow, you should
        still make sure you're not using Subversion to solve a problem
        that other tools solve better.  For example, because
        Subversion replicates data to all the collaborators involved,
        a common misuse is to treat it as a generic distribution
        system.  People will sometimes use Subversion to distribute
        huge collections of photos, digital music, or software
        packages.  The problem is that this sort of data usually isn't
        changing at all.  The collection itself grows over time, but
        the individual files within the collection aren't being
        changed.  In this case, using Subversion
        is <quote>overkill.</quote><footnote><para>Or as a friend puts
        it, <quote>swatting a fly with a
        Buick.</quote></para></footnote> There are simpler tools that
        efficiently replicate data <emphasis>without</emphasis> the
        overhead of tracking changes, such as <command>rsync</command>

      </indexterm>

      <para>In early 2000, CollabNet,
        Inc. (<ulink url="http://www.collab.net"/>) began seeking
        developers to write a replacement for CVS.  CollabNet
        offered<footnote><para>CollabNet Enterprise Edition has since
        been replaced by a new product line called CollabNet
        TeamForge.</para></footnote> a collaboration software suite
        called CollabNet Enterprise Edition (CEE), of which one
        component was version control.  Although CEE used CVS as its
        initial version control system, CVS's limitations were obvious
        from the beginning, and CollabNet knew it would eventually
        have to find something better.  Unfortunately, CVS had become
        the de facto standard in the open source world largely because
        there <emphasis>wasn't</emphasis> anything better, at least
        not under a free license.  So CollabNet determined to write a
        new version control system from scratch, retaining the basic
        ideas of CVS, but without the bugs and misfeatures.</para>
  
      <para>In February 2000, they contacted Karl Fogel, the author of
        <citetitle>Open Source Development with CVS</citetitle>
        (Coriolis, 1999), and asked if he'd like to work on this new
        project.  Coincidentally, at the time Karl was already
        discussing a design for a new version control system with his
        friend Jim Blandy.  In 1995, the two had started Cyclic
        Software, a company providing CVS support contracts, and
        although they later sold the business, they still used CVS
        every day at their jobs.  Their frustration with CVS had led
        Jim to think carefully about better ways to manage versioned
        data, and he'd already come up with not only the Subversion
        name, but also the basic design of the Subversion data store.
        When CollabNet called, Karl immediately agreed to work on the
        project, and Jim got his employer, Red Hat Software, to
        essentially donate him to the project for an indefinite period
        of time.  CollabNet hired Karl and Ben Collins-Sussman, and
        detailed design work began in May 2000.  With the help of some
        well-placed prods from Brian Behlendorf and Jason Robbins of
        CollabNet, and from Greg Stein (at the time an independent
        developer active in the WebDAV/DeltaV specification process),
        Subversion quickly attracted a community of active developers.
        It turned out that many people had encountered the same
        frustrating experiences with CVS and welcomed the chance to
        finally do something about it.</para>
  
      <para>The original design team settled on some simple goals.  They
        didn't want to break new ground in version control methodology,
        they just wanted to fix CVS.  They decided that Subversion would
        match CVS's features and preserve the same development model,
        but not duplicate CVS's most obvious flaws.  And although it did
        not need to be a drop-in replacement for CVS, it should be
        similar enough that any CVS user could make the switch with
        little effort.</para>
  
      <para>After 14 months of coding, Subversion became
        <quote>self-hosting</quote> on August 31, 2001.  That is,
        Subversion developers stopped using CVS to manage Subversion's
        own source code and started using Subversion instead.</para>
  
      <para>While CollabNet started the project, and still funds a
        large chunk of the work (it pays the salaries of a few
        full-time Subversion developers), Subversion is run like most
        open source projects, governed by a loose, transparent set of
        rules that encourage meritocracy.  In 2009, CollabNet worked
        with the Subversion developers towards the goal of integrating
        the Subversion project into the Apache Software Foundation
        (ASF), one of the most well-known collectives of open source
        projects in the world.  Subversion's technical roots,
        community priorities, and development practices were a perfect
        fit for the ASF, many of whose members were already active
        Subversion contributors.  In early 2010, Subversion was fully
        adopted into the ASF's family of top-level projects, moved its
        project web presence to
        <ulink url="http://subversion.apache.org"/>, and was
        rechristened <quote>Apache Subversion</quote>.</para>

      <para>The first edition of this book was published by O'Reilly
        Media in 2004, shortly after Subversion had reached 1.0.
        Since that time, the Subversion project has continued to
        release new major releases of the software.  Here's a quick
        summary of major new changes since Subversion 1.0.  Note that

          <listitem>
            <para>Release 1.1 introduced FSFS, a flat-file repository
              storage option for the repository.  While the Berkeley DB
              backend is still widely used and supported, FSFS has
              since become the default choice for
              newly created repositories due to its low barrier to
              entry and minimal maintenance requirements.  Also in
              this release came the ability to put symbolic links
              under version control, auto-escaping of URLs, and a
              localized user interface.</para>

          <listitem>
            <para>Release 1.2 introduced the ability to create
              server-side locks on files, thus serializing commit
              access to certain resources.  While Subversion is still
              a fundamentally concurrent version control system,
              certain types of binary files (e.g. art assets)
              cannot be merged together.  The locking feature fulfills
              the need to version and protect such resources.  With
              locking also came a complete WebDAV auto-versioning
              implementation, allowing Subversion repositories to be
              mounted as network folders.  Finally, Subversion 1.2
              began using a new, faster binary-differencing algorithm
              to compress and retrieve old versions of files.</para>

            <para>Release 1.3 brought path-based authorization
              controls to the <command>svnserve</command> server,
              matching a feature formerly found only in the Apache
              server.  The Apache server, however, gained some new
              logging features of its own, and Subversion's API
              bindings to other languages also made great leaps
              forward.</para>

          <listitem>
            <para>Release 1.4 introduced a whole new
              tool&mdash;<command>svnsync</command>&mdash;for doing
              one-way repository replication over a network.  Major
              parts of the working copy metadata were revamped to no
              longer use XML (resulting in client-side speed gains),
              while the Berkeley DB repository backend gained the
              ability to automatically recover itself after a server
              crash.</para>

          <listitem>
            <para>Release 1.5 took much longer to finish than prior
              releases, but the headliner feature was gigantic:
              semi-automated tracking of branching and merging.  This
              was a huge boon for users, and pushed Subversion far
              beyond the abilities of CVS and into the ranks of
              commercial competitors such as Perforce and ClearCase.
              Subversion 1.5 also introduced a bevy of other
              user-focused features, such as interactive resolution of
              file conflicts, sparse checkouts, client-side
              management of changelists, powerful new syntax for
              externals definitions, and SASL authentication support for

          <listitem>
            <para>Release 1.6 continued to make branching and merging
              more robust by introducing tree conflicts, and offered
              improvements to several other existing features: more
              interactive conflict resolution options; de-telescoping
              and outright exclusion support for sparse checkouts;
              file-based externals definitions; and operational
              logging support for <command>svnserve</command> similar
              to what <command>mod_dav_svn</command> offered.  Also,
              the command-line client introduced a new shortcut syntax
              for referring to Subversion repository URLs.</para>

          <listitem>
            <para>Release 1.7 was primarily a delivery vehicle for two
              big plumbing overhauls of existing Subversion
              components.  The largest and most impactful of these was
              the so-called <quote>WC-NG</quote>&mdash;a complete
              rewrite of the <command>libsvn_wc</command> working copy
              management library.  The second change was the
              introduction of a sleeker HTTP protocol for Subversion
              client/server interaction.  Subversion 1.7 delivered a
              handful of additional features, many bug fixes, and some
              notable performance improvements, too.</para>

    <title>Audience</title>
    
    <para>This book is written for computer-literate folk who want to
      use Subversion to manage their data.  While Subversion runs on a
      number of different operating systems, its primary user
      interface is command-line-based.  That command-line tool
      (<command>svn</command>), and some additional auxiliary
      programs, are the focus of this book.</para>

    <para>For consistency, the examples in this book assume that the reader
      is using a Unix-like operating system and is relatively comfortable
      with Unix and command-line interfaces.  That said, the
      <command>svn</command> program also runs on non-Unix platforms
      such as Microsoft Windows.  With a few minor exceptions, such as
      the use of backward slashes (<literal>\</literal>) instead of
      forward slashes (<literal>/</literal>) for path separators, the
      input to and output from this tool when run on Windows are
      identical to that of its Unix counterpart.</para>

    <para>Most readers are probably programmers or system
      administrators who need to track changes to source code.  This
      is the most common use for Subversion, and therefore it is the
      scenario underlying all of the book's examples.  But Subversion
      can be used to manage changes to any sort of
      information&mdash;images, music, databases, documentation, and
      so on.  To Subversion, all data is just data.</para>
    
    <para>While this book is written with the assumption that the
      reader has never used a version control system, we've also tried
      to make it easy for users of CVS (and other systems) to make a
      painless leap into Subversion.  Special sidebars may mention
      other version control systems from time to time, and
      <xref linkend="svn.forcvs"/> summarizes many of the differences
      between CVS and Subversion.</para>

    <para>Note also that the source code examples used throughout the
      book are only examples.  While they will compile with the proper
      compiler incantations, they are intended to illustrate a
      particular scenario and not necessarily to serve as examples of good
      programming style or practices.</para>

    <title>How to Read This Book</title>

    <para>Technical books always face a certain dilemma:  whether to
      cater to <firstterm>top-down</firstterm>
      or to <firstterm>bottom-up</firstterm> learners.  A top-down
      learner prefers to read or skim documentation, getting a large
      overview of how the system works; only then does she actually
      start using the software.  A bottom-up learner is a <quote>learn by
      doing</quote> person&mdash;someone who just wants to dive into the
      software and figure it out as she goes, referring to book
      sections when necessary.  Most books tend to be written for one
      type of person or the other, and this book is undoubtedly biased
      toward top-down learners.  (And if you're actually reading this
      section, you're probably already a top-down learner yourself!)
      However, if you're a bottom-up person, don't despair.  While the
      book may be laid out as a broad survey of Subversion topics, the
      content of each section tends to be heavy with specific
      examples that you can try-by-doing.  For the impatient folks who
      just want to get going, you can jump right to
      <xref linkend="svn.intro"/>.</para>

    <para>Regardless of your learning style, this book aims to be
      useful to people of widely different backgrounds&mdash;from
      those with no previous experience in version control to
      experienced system administrators.  Depending on your own
      background, certain chapters may be more or less important to
      you.  The following can be considered a
      <quote>recommended reading list</quote> for various types of
      readers:</para>

      <varlistentry>
        <term>Experienced system administrators</term>
        <listitem>
          <para>The assumption here is that you've probably used
            version control before and are dying to get a
            Subversion server up and running ASAP.
            <xref linkend="svn.reposadmin"/> and
            <xref linkend="svn.serverconfig"/> will show you how to
            create your first repository and make it available over
            the network.  After that's done,
            <xref linkend="svn.tour"/> and
            <xref linkend="svn.forcvs"/> are the fastest routes to
            learning the Subversion client.</para>

        <listitem>
          <para>Your administrator has probably set up Subversion
            already, and you need to learn how to use the client.  If
            you've never used a version control system, then
            <xref linkend="svn.basic"/> is a vital introduction to the
            ideas behind version control.  <xref linkend="svn.tour"/>
            is a guided tour of the Subversion client.</para>

      <varlistentry>
        <term>Advanced users</term>
        <listitem>
          <para>Whether you're a user or administrator, eventually
            your project will grow larger.  You're going to want to
            learn how to do more advanced things with Subversion, such
            as how to use Subversion's property support
            (<xref linkend="svn.advanced"/>), how to use branches and
            perform merges (<xref linkend="svn.branchmerge"/>), how to
            configure runtime options
            (<xref linkend="svn.customization"/>), and other things.
            These chapters aren't critical at first, but be sure to
            read them once you're comfortable with the basics.</para>

      <varlistentry>
        <term>Developers</term>
        <listitem>
          <para>Presumably, you're already familiar with Subversion,
            and now want to either extend it or build new software on
            top of its many APIs.  <xref linkend="svn.developer"/> is
            just for you.</para>
        </listitem>
      </varlistentry>
    </variablelist>

    <para>The book ends with reference material&mdash;<xref
      linkend="svn.ref"/> is a reference guide for all Subversion
      commands, and the appendixes cover a number of useful topics.
      These are the chapters you're mostly likely to come back to
      after you've finished the book.</para>
