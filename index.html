<h2>Introduction</h2>
<a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/"><img src="somerights20.png" align=right border=0></a>
<p>This is the online home of <u>Version Control with Subversion</u>,
   a <a href="http://svnbook.red-bean.com/svnbook/ape.html">free</a>
   book about <a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/">Subversion</a>, a
   new version control system designed to supplant CVS.  As you may
   have guessed from the layout of this page. this book is published by 
   <a href="http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/0596004486/">O'Reilly Media</a>.</p>

<p>This is a place to
   read HTML and PDF versions of the book (although you can certainly
   <a href="/buy/">buy</a> a copy if you'd like to).  We'll do our best
   to keep the site up-to-date.  As Subversion development continues, the
   product will continue to grow new features, and we plan to continue
   documenting those changes.</p>

<h2>Are Those Turtles?</h2>

<p>Why, yes, they are, indeed, turtles.  That's the animal chosen by
   the publisher for our book cover.  And before you ask us, "Why?"
   &mdash; we don't really know.  It's cool, and our wives are pleased
   that at least something "icky" wasn't chosen to represent
   Subversion.</p>
