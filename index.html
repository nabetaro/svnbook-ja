    <h1>Version Control with Subversion</h1>


    <p>Someday, this will be the home of <u>Version Control with
Subversion</u>, a free book about <a 
    href="http://subversion.tigris.org">Subversion</a>, a new version
    control system designed to supplant CVS.  This book is a work in
    progress, which will be published by O'Reilly and
    Associates later this year (2003).</p>

    of the book.</p>
