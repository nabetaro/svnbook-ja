    <h1>Subversion: The Definitive Guide</h1>


    <p>Someday, this will be the home of <u>Subversion: The Definitive
    Guide</u>, a free book about <a
    href="http://subversion.tigris.org">Subversion</a>, a new version
    control system designed to supplant CVS.  This book is a work in
    progress, which will someday be published by O'Reilly and
    Associates.</p>

    <p>For now, it is simply a place to read the on-line HTML version
    of the book.  PDF and Postscript versions of the book can be found
    in the <a
    href="http://subversion.tigris.org/servlets/ProjectDocumentList?folderID=256">file-sharing section</a>
    of Subversion's website.</p>

    <p>Read the <a href="book.html">HTML edition</a> of the book.</p>
