<h1>Version Control with Subversion</h1>

<h2>Do What?</h2>

<p>Someday, this will be the home of <u>Version Control with
   Subversion</u>, a free book about <a
   href="http://subversion.tigris.org">Subversion</a>, a new version
   control system designed to supplant CVS.  This book is a work in
   progress, which will be published by O'Reilly and Associates in
   mid-2004.</p>

<p>For now, it is simply a place to read the on-line HTML and PDF
   versions of the book.</p>

<h2>Ooh!  Me too!</h2>

<p>Read the current drafts of the book here (Revision 9189,
   2004-03-22):</p>

<ul>

  <li>View the <a href="book/book.html">single-page HTML edition</a> of the
      book (852KB)</li>

  <li>View the <a href="book/index.html">multiple-page HTML edition</a> of
      the book</li>

  <li>View the <a href="book/book.pdf">PDF edition</a> of the book
      (1.252MB)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Errata</h2>

<p>The book is mostly complete, but still lacking coverage on certain
   topics.  Other topics need to be clarified.  The authors have some
   running "to-do" lists which you can see <a
   href="http://svn.collab.net/repos/svn/trunk/doc/book/TODO">here</a>
   and <a
   href="http://svn.collab.net/repos/svn/trunk/doc/book/REVIEW">here</a>.
   Before emailing feedback about errors or missing information,
   please take a look at those lists.  We may already be aware of the
   problem.  Thanks!</p>
