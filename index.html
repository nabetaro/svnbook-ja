    <h1>Version Control with Subversion</h1>


    <p>Someday, this will be the home of <u>Version Control with
Subversion</u>, a free book about <a 
    href="http://subversion.tigris.org">Subversion</a>, a new version
    control system designed to supplant CVS.  This book is a work in
    progress, which will be published by O'Reilly and
    Associates in mid-2004.</p>

    of the book.</p>

<b>Errata Note</b>: <P> The book is mostly complete, but still lacking
      coverage on certain topics.  Other topics need to be clarified.
      The authors have some running "to-do" lists which you can see <a
      href="http://svn.collab.net/repos/svn/trunk/doc/book/TODO">here</a>
      and <a
      href="http://svn.collab.net/repos/svn/trunk/doc/book/REVIEW">here</a>.
      Before emailing feedback about errors or missing information,
      please take a look at those lists.  We may already be aware of
      the problem.  Thanks!</p>

      <p>Please send any questions, comments, patches, gifts, praise, or errors to <a href="mailto:dev@subversion.tigris.org">dev@subversion.tigris.org</a>.  Be sure to include the word [BOOK] in the subject line, and [BOOK PATCH] if it's a patch.</p>
