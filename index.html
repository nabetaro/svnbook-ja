<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>This is the online home of <u>Version Control with Subversion</u>,
   a <a href="http://svn.collab.net/repos/svn/trunk/COPYING">free</a>
   book about <a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/">Subversion</a>, a
   new version control system designed to supplant CVS.  This book is
   a work in progress, which will be published by 
   <a href="http://oreilly.com/">O'Reilly and Associates</a> in
   mid-2004.</p>

<p>In the meantime (and, well, even thereafter), this is a place to
   read HTML and PDF versions of the book.  We'll do our best to keep
   the site up-to-date.  As Subversion development continues, the
   product will continue to grow new features, and we plan to continue
   documenting those changes.</p>

<h2>Online Versions of the Book</h2>

<p>Read the current drafts of the book here (Revision 9189,
   2004-03-22):</p>

    XML sources</a>.
</ul>

<h2>Errata</h2>

<p>The book is mostly complete, but still lacking coverage on certain
   topics.  Other topics need to be clarified.  The authors have some
   running "to-do" lists (see the <a
   href="http://svn.collab.net/repos/svn/trunk/doc/book/REVIEW">REVIEW</a>
   and <a
   href="http://svn.collab.net/repos/svn/trunk/doc/book/TODO">TODO</a>
   files in the XML sources).  Before emailing feedback about errors
   or missing information, please take a look at those lists.  We may
   already be aware of the problem.  Thanks!</p>

<h2>Contributing</h2>

<p>Please send any questions, comments, patches, gifts, praise, or
   errors to the Subversion development mailing list (<a
   href="mailto:dev@subversion.tigris.org">dev@subversion.tigris.org</a>
   &mdash; you need not be subscribed).  Be sure to include the word
   <tt>[BOOK]</tt> in the subject line, and <tt>[BOOK PATCH]</tt> if
   submitting a patch.  Please make your patches against the XML
   sources.</p>

<h2>Are Those Turtles?</h2>

<p>Why, yes, they are, indeed, turtles.  That's the animal chosen by
   the publisher for our book cover.  And before you ask us, "Why?"
   &mdash; we don't really know.  It's cool, and our wives are pleased
   that at least something "icky" wasn't chosen to represent
   Subversion.</p>
